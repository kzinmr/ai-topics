# Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Python

Source: https://jyn.dev/terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-python/

time for everyone's favorite game!!
what does this code do?
def
foo
(
)
:
try
:
return
os
.
_exit
(
)
finally
:
return
False
import
os
foo
(
)
does it:
return None
return False
throw an exception
exit the process without printing anything
something even more devious
sit with it. have a good think. explain your answers.
ready?
ok fine what does it do
returns
False
. want to know why?
yes just tell me already >:(
normally,
os._exit
exits the process without running "cleanup handlers" (
finally
blocks). however, it takes one argument. this snippet forgets to pass in the exit code, so instead of exiting, it throws
TypeError
. then the
finally
block silently swallows the exception because of the
return
.
return
from a
finally
block is in fact so commonly misused that the python developers
plan
to make it emit a
SyntaxWarning
in a future release.
one might be mislead that
import os
comes after the function is defined. but python has dynamic scoping, so that's fine.
one might also mix up
sys.exit
with
os._exit
.
sys.exit
works by raising a
SystemExit
exception, which would be caught and swallowed by the
finally
block. but
_exit
directly exits the process:
Exit the process with status n, without calling cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers, etc.
in fact, it doesn't even call atexit handlers, not even if we directly use libc:
>>> import atexit
>>> atexit.register(lambda: print('hi'))
<function <lambda> at 0x73c740cf2830>
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> libc = cdll.LoadLibrary("libc.so.6")
>>> libc.on_exit(CFUNCTYPE(c_int, c_voidp)(lambda status, _: print(status)))
0
>>> import os
>>> os._exit(1)
# no output
yes someone did write this code by accident and yes they were very confused. i thought it was a bug in cpython until i figured it out.
you're welcome!!
