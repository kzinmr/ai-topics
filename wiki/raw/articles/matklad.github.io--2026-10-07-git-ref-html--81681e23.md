# On Git Refs

Source: https://matklad.github.io/2026/10/07/git-ref.html

I have recently improved my mental model of Git. Consider these two git commands:
$
git fetch origin master
$
git switch -c my-feature origin/master
Do you understand why is it
origin master
in one command, and
origin/master
in the other? I didn’t, until a few weeks ago!
My understanding was that git is a content-addressable database. Git stores
commits, a commit is identified by the hash of its content, and the content
of a commit is, primarily:
a memory-less snapshot of a state of the codebase at a given point in time,
a list of (hashes of) parent commits.
That was enough git for me to understand
git log
output and get me out of any
botched rebase without having to re-clone the repo (For roughly half of my
career, I
was
re-cloning the repo. No shame in that! Learning git is useful,
but it’s not the
highest
priority thing to learn when you start).
I now understand that git not only comes with an append-only (“immutable”)
content-addressable database, but is also a boring mutable key-value store.
Git has a mutable map whose keys are strings, and whose values are
content-addressed objects. The keys are conventionally formatted as file system
paths, and you can usually inspect the state of the mapping by listing
.git/refs
directory:
$
eza -T .git/refs
.git/refs
├── heads
│   ├── make
│   ├── master
│   ├── my-feature
│   └── pbd-adt
├── origin
├── remotes
│   └── origin
│       ├── context-switches
│       ├── gh-pages
│       ├── HEAD
│       ├── make
│       └── master
└── tags
$
cat .git/refs/heads/master
b59148228e52f7c615ead7fdd4e91001994ad50f
$
git show-ref refs/heads/master
b59148228e52f7c615ead7fdd4e91001994ad50f refs/heads/master
What makes this
refs
KV infrastructure confusing is that:
It powers many distinct user-visible git features, but refs themselves are an
implementation detail.
It is a bit of a leaky abstraction, refs are
almost
invisible in the
day-to-day usage.
Git CLI uses shorthand notation for refs and many default arguments, which
makes it not obvious that a particular CLI argument is a ref.
And, as usual, git likes to give several names to one thing, and re-uses the
same name for distinct things.
Branches, tags, and git notes are all just refs!
The structure becomes much more obvious once you elaborate all CLI shortcuts. The original command
$
git fetch origin master
then becomes
$
git fetch \
https://github.com/matklad/matklad.github.io \
refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
The first argument of
fetch
(
https://...
) is a location of a remote
repository. Git will “dial” that address, and will transfer some data from that
computer locally over the network.
The second argument is a
source:target
pair of string keys (refs). The
source
is a key on the remote repo, the
target
is the name of a local key,
and fetch as a whole asks git to read a value from a remote repository and save
it locally under a different name.
To avoid typing repository URLs all the time, git assigns them symbolic names,
with
origin
being the conventional name for the primary remote repository:
$
git fetch origin \
refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
refs/heads/master
is a fully elaborated name of a branch on the remote repo.
That is, branch
my-feature
is just a
refs/heads/my-feature
ref. It could
have been
refs/branch/my-feature
,
but it isn’t :)
I don’t know the specific shorthand rules, but, generally, git allows you to
spell only the suffix of a ref:
$
git fetch origin \
master:refs/remotes/origin/master
refs/remotes/origin/master
is the name of the local ref we’ll use to store the
result. It would seem natural to just use the same name locally as the one on
the remote, but this only works if there’s a single remote. If there are two
upstream repositories (for example, your fork, and the original repo you forked
from), their ref names will collide. That’s why we want to namespace the refs
for remote called
foo
under
refs/remotes/foo
. And
origin
is just a
conventional name for
the
remote in simple setups.
Again, it would be more natural to
directly
mirror remote ref structure
locally:
refs/ heads/my-branch -> refs/ remotes/origin/ heads/my-branch
but git strips the redundant heads component. And this
-heads
,
+remotes/$remote
mapping is built in, which compresses the command to
$
git fetch origin master
It’s worth reflecting
why
it works this way. Git model is offline first.
What’s more, it assumes
explicit
synchronization points. Rather than
synchronizing with the remote repository in background when there’s
connectivity, git requires explicit
fetch
and
push
operations to transfer
bytes over the wire. In this paradigm, it is useful to model the state of the
remote party at the moment when we talked to them the last time. Theory of mind!
This
hopefully
deconfuses git’s concept of local and remote branches. Consider
the
main
branch. It exists on the remote named
origin
as
refs/heads/main
.
When you synchronize your local repository with
origin
, you get
refs/remotes/origin/main
—
you current best knowledge about the the state of
main
on the
origin
.
And then there’s your local
refs/heads/main
. It typically starts pointing at
the same commit as
refs/remotes/origin/main
.
But, when you make a commit,
refs/heads/main
advances, but
refs/remotes/origin/main
stays the same.
When you try to push your local commit to origin, you will get a conflict, if
the
main
branch on the
origin
advanced in the meanwhile. In that case, git
automatically updates
refs/remotes/origin/main
(as that’s just a local mirror of the remote state), but then it’s on you to
update
refs/heads/main
and push it again.
Revisiting the full example:
$
git fetch origin master
$
git switch -c my-feature origin/master
The first command looks up the URL for the
origin
remote in
.git/config
and
makes a network request to that machine. As a result, the local
refs/remotes/origin/master
gets updated to the same commit as
refs/heads/master
remotely (the commit and its ancestors are transferred
locally as a result).
The second command creates a
refs/heads/my-feature
ref (a branch), whose
starting point is
refs/remotes/origin/master
. It is an example of a leaky
abstraction.
The second argument there is a (shorthand of a) ref, so you can do
$ git switch -c my-feature \
refs/remotes/origin/master
But, although the first argument
creates
a ref, it isn’t a ref itself. In
other words, if you try to elaborate it as well
$ git switch -c refs/heads/my-feature \
refs/remotes/origin/master
you’ll get
refs/heads/refs/heads/my-feature
That’s all! I am pretty sure this isn’t particularly useful, but maybe it is
interesting!
