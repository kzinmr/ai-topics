# scaffold-docs

A skill for writing technical documentation for human readers. It builds the docs top-down in passes, and you review and approve each pass before it continues.

## What it does

`scaffold-docs` guides an agent through producing a three-tier documentation set for a code library:

- **Getting Started:** a narrative tutorial covering a single representative use case
- **Diving Deeper:** one file per topic, organized around intent and design decisions
- **Reference:** per-module API spec, lookup-oriented

Each section is built in passes: structure first, then headers and topic sentences, then full prose. The agent pauses for your review between passes and does not advance until you approve.

Key principles baked in: write for a specific audience, build the reader's mental model before enumerating API surface, explain *why* over *what*, and apply Strunk & White prose standards throughout.

You will spend most of *your* time working on **Getting Started**. That's where agents need the most help.

### Keeping docs in sync

Code keeps changing after the docs are written. The skill records the audience and
the commit the docs were last synced to in a `.scaffold-docs.yml` file. When you
ask it to update or refresh the docs, it diffs the code since that commit, sorts
the changes by whether they warrant doc edits, and walks the Getting Started,
Diving Deeper, and Reference sections one at a time, proposing changes for your
review in each.

## Principles

1. **Write for a specific audience.** You write documentation *for* someone. A primary audience governs every choice: narrative selection, scaffolding, benefit framing, what to explain, what to skip. Secondary audiences are kept in mind, but they never outrank the primary.
2. **Build a mental model.** The job of documentation written for humans is to establish a mental model that allows for reasoning about a library. Exhaustive details are for the agents.
3. **Scaffold information.** Organize the documentation by what the primary audience is trying to do and in a manner that helps them incrementally build a mental model. Source-code directory structure is rarely the right structure for the docs.
4. **Communicate intent.** Design decisions help support mental models by explaining why something works the way it does. The agent should use code comments, naming choices, and code smells as evidence of intent.
5. **Quality writing matters.** Prose quality is part of the deliverable. This skill helps, but human discernment and style are needed (*especially* in the "Getting Started" section).
6. **The author remains in the loop.** Agents still struggle with structure, empathy, and quality writing. This process is designed for user guidance at critical moments.

## Installation

Copy or symlink this folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```
~/.claude/skills/scaffold-docs/
```

## Usage

Most usage will invoke the skill directly, beginning the process with a clean context:

```
/scaffold-docs
```

To refresh existing docs after the code has changed, ask the skill to update them:

```
/scaffold-docs update the docs
```

If no audience was recorded (for docs written before this feature, or by hand),
the skill offers to define one with you, or to stop asking and match the existing
docs' style instead.
