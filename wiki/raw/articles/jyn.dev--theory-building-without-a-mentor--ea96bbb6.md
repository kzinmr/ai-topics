theory building
Peter Naur wrote a famous article in 1985 called
Programming as Theory Building
. it has some excellent ideas, such as:
programming must be the programmers’ building up knowledge of a certain kind, knowledge taken to be basically the programmers’ immediate possession, any documentation being an auxiliary product.
solutions suggested by group B [who did not possess a theory of the program] […] effectively destroyed its power and simplicity. The members of group A [who did possess a theory] were able to spot these cases instantly and could propose simple and effective solutions, framed entirely within the existing structure.
the program text and its documentation proved insufficient as a carrier of the most important design ideas
i think this article is excellent, and highly recommend reading it in full. however, i want to discuss one particular idea Naur mentions:
For a new programmer to come to possess an existing theory of a program it is insufficient that he or she has the opportunity to become familiar with the program text and other documentation. What is required is that the new programmer has the opportunity to work in close contact with the programmers who already possess the theory [...] program revival, that is reestablishing the theory of a program merely from the documentation, is strictly impossible.
i do not think it is true that it is impossible to recover a theory of the program merely from the code and docs. my day job, and indeed one of my most prized skills when i interview for jobs, is creating a theory of programs from their text and documentation alone. this blog post is about how i do that, and how you can too.
theory modification
Naur also says in the article:
“in a certain sense there can be no question of theory modification, only program modification”
i think this is wrong: theory modification is exactly what Ward Cunningham describes as "consolidation" in his 1992 article on
Technical Debt
. i highly recommend the original article, but the basic idea is that over time, your understanding of how the program
should
behave changes, and you modify and refactor your program to match that idea. this happens in all programs, but the modification is easier in programs with little
technical risk
.
furthermore, this theory modification often happens unintentionally over time as people are added and removed from teams. as
ceejbot puts it
:
This is Conway’s Law over time. Teams are immutable: adding or removing a person to a team produces a different team. After enough change, the team is different enough that it no longer recognizes itself in the software system it produces. The result is people being vaguely unhappy about software that might be working perfectly well.
i bring this up to note that you will never recover the
same
theory as the original programmers (at least, not without talking to them directly). the most you can do is to recover one similar enough that it does not require large changes to the program. in other words, you are creating a new theory of the program, and may end up having to adapt the program to your new theory.
recreating a theory
this is useful both when fixing bugs and when adding new features; i will focus on new features because i want to emphasize that these skills are useful any time you modify a program. for a focus on debugging, see Julia Evans'
Pocket Guide to Debugging
.
this post is about creating theories at the "micro" level, for small portions of the program. i hope to make a post about the "macro" level in the future, since that's what really lets you start making design decisions about a program.
i recently made a
PR to neovim
, having never worked on neovim before; i'll use that as an example going forward.
i highly recommend following along with a piece of code you want to learn more about. if you don't have one in mind, i have hidden all the examples behind a drop-down menu, so you can try to apply the ideas on your own before seeing how i use them.
the investigation i did in this blog post was based off
neovim commit 57d99a5
.

where to start
to start off, you need an idea of what change you want to make to the program. almost always, programs are too large for you to get an idea of the whole program at once. instead, you need to focus on theory-building for the parts you care about, and only understand the rest of the program to the extent that the parts you care about interact with it.
in my neovim PR, i cared about the
:drop
command, which opens a file if it isn't loaded, or switches to the relevant buffer if it is. specifically i wanted to extend the "switch to the relevant buffer" part to also respect
+cmd
, so that i could pass it a line number.
finding the parts you care about
there are several ways to get started here. the simplest is just finding the relevant part of the code or docs—if you can provoke an error that's related to the part of the code you're changing, you can search for that error directly. often, knowing
how
execution reaches that state is very helpful, which you can do by getting a backtrace. you can get backtraces for output from arbitrary programs with
liberal use of rr
, but if you're debugging rustc specifically, there's actually a built-in flag for this, so you can just use
rustc file.rs -Z treat-err-as-bug
.
if this doesn't print an error message, or if it's not possible to get a recording of the program, things are harder. you want to look for something you already know the name of; search for literal strings with that name, or substrings that might form part of a template.
:drop
for
:drop
i searched for the literal string
"drop"
, since
something
needs to parse commands and it's not super common for it to be on its own in a string. that pulled up the following hits:
$ rg '"drop"' src
src/nvim/ex_docmd.c:4196:  } else if (STRICMP(p, "drop") == 0) {
src/nvim/ex_docmd.c:4213:    "drop",
src/nvim/ex_docmd.c:4302:    // "drop".
src/nvim/eval.c:7146:    len += 7 + 4;  // " ++bad=" + "keep" or "drop"
ex_docmd.c
looked promising, so i read the code around there.
reading source code
sometimes triggering the condition is hard, so instead i read the source code to reverse-engineer the stack trace. seeing all possible call sites of a function is instructive in itself, and you can usually narrow it down to only a few callers by skimming what the callers are doing. i highly recommend using an LSP for this part since the advantage comes from seeing
all
possible callers, not just most, and regex is less reliable than proper name resolution.
:drop
it turned out that none of the code i found in my search was for
:drop
itself, but i did find it was in a function named
get_bad_opt
.
get_bad_opt
had only one caller,
getargopt
. that was called by
do_one_cmd
. the doc-comment on
do_one_cmd
mentions that it parses the string, but i am not used to having documentation so i went up one level too far to
do_cmdline
. at that point, looking at the call site of
do_one_cmd
, i realized i had gone too far because it was passing in the whole string of the Ex command line. i found a more relevant part of the code by looking at the uses of
cmdlinep
in
do_one_cmd
:
char
*
cmdname
=
after_modifier
?
after_modifier
:
*
cmdlinep
;
i got lucky - this was not actually the code i cared about, but the bit i did care about had a similar name, so i found it by searching for
cmdname
:
if
(
!
IS_USER_CMDIDX
(
ea
.
cmdidx
)
)
{
ea
.
argt
=
cmdnames
[
(
int
)
ea
.
cmdidx
]
.
cmd_argt
;
}
from there i went to the definition of
cmdnames
(in
build/src/nvim/auto/ex_cmds_defs.generated.h
) and found
"drop"
in that file:
[
CMD_drop
]
=
{
.
cmd_name
=
"
drop
"
,
.
cmd_func
=
(
ex_func_T
)
&
ex_drop
,
.
cmd_preview_func
=
NULL
,
.
cmd_argt
=
147854
L
,
.
cmd_addr_type
=
ADDR_NONE
}
,
and from there found that the function i cared about was called
ex_drop
.
if i had been a little more careful, i could have found
CMD_drop
sooner with
rg -ul '"drop"'
(this time without filtering out hidden files or limiting to the source directory). but this way worked fine as well.
verifying your understanding
do mini experiments: if you see an error emitted in nearby code, try to trigger it so that you verify you're looking in the right place. when debugging, i often use process of elimination to narrow down callers: if an error would have been emitted if a certain code path was taken, or if there would have been more or less logging, i can be sure that code i am looking at was not run.
the simplest experiment is just
exit(1)
; it's easy to notice and doesn't change the state of the program, and it can't fail. other experiments could include "adding custom logging" or "change the behavior of the function", which let you perform multiple experiments at once and understand how the function impacts its callers.
for more complicated code, i like to use a debugger, which lets you see much more of the state at once. if possible, in-editor debuggers are really nice—vscode, and
since recently, zed
, have one built-in; for nvim i use
nvim-dap-ui
. you can also just use a debugger in a terminal. some experiments i like to try:
breaking at a function to make sure it is executed
printing local variables
setting hardware watchpoints on memory to see where something is modified (this especially shines
in combination with a time-travel debugger
)
:drop
for
:drop
, i was quite confident i had found the right code, so i didn't bother with any experiments. there are other cases where it's more useful; i made an earlier
PR to tmux
where there were many different places search happened, so verifying i was looking at the right one was very helpful. specifically i added
exit(1)
to the function i thought was the right place, since debug logging in tmux is non-trivial to access.
i rarely use a debugger for adding new code; mostly i use it for debugging existing code. programs complicated enough that i need a debugger just to understand control flow usually have a client/server model that also makes them harder to debug, so i don't bother and just read the source code.
writing new code
reading source code is also useful for finding examples of how to use an API. often it handles edge cases you wouldn't know about by skimming, and uses helper functions that make your life simpler. your goal is to make your change as similar to the existing codebase as possible, both to reduce the risk of bugs and to increase the chance the maintainer likes your change.
when i write new code, i will usually copy a small snippet from elsewhere in the codebase and modify it to my needs. i try to copy at most 10-15 lines; more than that indicates that i should try to reuse or create a higher-level API.
:drop
once in
ex_drop
, i skimmed the code and found a snippet looked like it was handling existing files:
FOR_ALL_TAB_WINDOWS
(
tp
,
wp
)
{
if
(
wp
->
w_buffer
==
buf
)
{
goto_tabpage_win
(
tp
,
wp
)
;
curwin
->
w_arg_idx
=
0
;
if
(
!
bufIsChanged
(
curbuf
)
)
{
const
int
save_ar
=
curbuf
->
b_p_ar
;
curbuf
->
b_p_ar
=
true
;
buf_check_timestamp
(
curbuf
)
;
curbuf
->
b_p_ar
=
save_ar
;
}
if
(
curbuf
->
b_ml
.
ml_flags
&
ML_EMPTY
)
{
ex_rewind
(
eap
)
;
}
return
;
}
}
the bug here is not any code that is present; instead it's code that's missing. i had to figure out where
+cmd
was stored and how to process it.
so, i repeated a similar process for
+cmd
. this time i had something more to start with - i knew the command structure was named
eap
and had type
exarg_t
.
looking at the definition of
struct exarg
showed me what i wanted:
char
*
do_ecmd_cmd
;
///
<
+command arg to be used in edited file
looking for
do_ecmd_cmd
, i found
do_exbuffer
(with a helpful comment saying it was responsible for
:buffer
) which called
do_cmdline_cmd
, and in turn
do_cmdline
.
looking at the callers of
do_cmdline
i found
do_ecmd
, which handles
:edit
.
:edit
has exactly the behavior i wanted for
:drop
, so i copied its behavior:
do_cmdline
(
command
,
NULL
,
NULL
,
DOCMD_VERBOSE
)
;
out of caution, i also looked at the other places in the function that handled
command
, and it's a good thing i did, because i found this wild snippet above:
if
(
(
command
!=
NULL
||
newlnum
>
0
)
&&
*
get_vim_var_str
(
VV_SWAPCOMMAND
)
==
NUL
)
{
const
size_t
len
=
(
command
!=
NULL
)
?
strlen
(
command
)
+
3
:
30
;
char
*
const
p
=
xmalloc
(
len
)
;
if
(
command
!=
NULL
)
{
vim_snprintf
(
p
,
len
,
"
:
%s
\r
"
,
command
)
;
}
else
{
vim_snprintf
(
p
,
len
,
"
%
"
PRId64
"
G
"
,
(
int64_t
)
newlnum
)
;
}
set_vim_var_string
(
VV_SWAPCOMMAND
,
p
,
-
1
)
;
did_set_swapcommand
=
true
;
xfree
(
p
)
;
}
i refactored this into a helper function and then called it from both the original
:edit
command and my new code in
:drop
.
testing new code
this works in much the same way. try to find existing tests by using
the same techniques as finding the code you care about
. read them; write them using existing examples. tests are also code, after all.
test suites usually have better documentation than the code itself, since adding new tests is much more common than modifying any particular section of code; see if you can find the docs. i look for
CONTRIBUTING.md
files, and if i don't find them i fall back to skimming the readme. sometimes there are is also a
README.md
in the folder where the tests are located, although these tend to be somewhat out of date.
i care a lot about iteration times, so i try and find how to run individual tests. that info is usually in the README, or sometime you can figure it out from the test command's
--help
output.
run your tests! ideally, create and run your tests
before
modifying the code so that you can see that they start to pass after your change. tests are extra important when you don't already understand the code, because they help you verify that your new theory is correct. run existing tests as well; run those before you make changes so you know which failures are spurious (a surprisingly high number of codebases have flaky or environment-dependent tests).
:drop
i started by looking for existing tests for
:drop
:
$
rg :drop test
test/functional/ex_cmds/drop_spec.lua:8:describe
(
'
:drop
'
, function(
)
test/functional/ex_cmds/drop_spec.lua:75:
:drop Xdrop_modified.txt
|
test/old/testdir/test_winfixbuf.vim:1094:
"
Fail :drop but :drop! is allowed
test/old/testdir/test_excmd.vim:92:
"
Test for the :drop command
test/old/testdir/test_excmd.vim:775:
call term_sendkeys(buf,
"
:drop Xdrop_modified.txt\<CR>
"
)
fortunately this had results right away and i was able to start adding my new test.
CONTRIBUTING.md
had a pointer to
test/README.md
which documented
TEST_FILE
and
mak functionaltest
. neovim has very good internal tooling and when my
screen:expect()
call failed it gave me a very helpful pointer to
screen:snapshot_util
.
what have we learned?
programming is theory building
.
recovering a theory from code and docs alone is hard, but possible.
most programs are too large for you to understand them all at once. decide on your goal and learn just enough to accomplish it.
reading source code is surprisingly rewarding.
match the existing code as closely as you can until you are sure you have a working theory.
hopefully this was helpful! i am told by my friends that i am unusually good at this skill, so i am interested whether this post was effective at teaching it. if you have any questions, or if you just want to get in contact, feel free to reach out
