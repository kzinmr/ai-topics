Benchmark In Milliseconds
Oct 5, 2026
How long should a micro benchmark run? My rule of thumb is to tweak the input
size until the benchmark takes about 300ms, for the following reasons:
Milliseconds are integers ranging from 1 to 999. Enough precision to notice
even a small improvement, and easy to scan visually. No need for different
units or floating points (compare
1.31s
with
239ms
).
Anything faster than, say,
10ms
risks being skewed by fixed costs (e.g,
interpreter startup). Hundreds of milliseconds is an eternity for a computer,
usually enough to make one-off overheads irrelevant without using fancier (=
less robust) techniques to explicitly account for them.
For a human, hundreds of milliseconds is fast, but noticeable. Pushing numbers
into human-perceptible range allows me to use my intuitive sense of time and
speed, it doesn’t rely exclusively on numeracy. It’s plain fun to see, as a
result of optimization work, how a previously lagging CLI command becomes
“instant”.
But anything longer than a second makes
iterating
on the benchmark slower
than it needs to be. Running a benchmark 10 times in a row to eyeball variance
should be fast!
The imminently-to-be-stated assumption here is that the purpose of benchmarking
isn’t so much a precise measurement of performance, but rather providing the
author with enough intuition to make a correct decision.
