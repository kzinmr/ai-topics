# lld 23 ELF changes

Source: https://maskray.me/blog/lld-23-elf-changes

LLVM 23.1 has been released. As usual, I maintain lld/ELF and as
volunteer work have added some notes to
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/23.x/lld/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst
.
Like last time, I used Claude Code to summarize
git log llvmorg-23-init..origin/release/23.x -- lld/ELF
,
excluding changes cherry-picked into 22.x
(
git rev-list llvmorg-23-init..llvmorg-22.1.8 -- lld
), and
then edited the draft.
This was a busy cycle: 141 commits landed in lld/ELF between the
branch point (2026-01-13) and 23.1.0-rc1 (2026-07-16), compared with 72
in the 22 cycle. Much of the increase is performance work, which I
described in
Recent
lld/ELF performance improvements
. lld 23 is the first release that
ships all of it.
Input file loading is now parallelized, meaningfully reducing link
time for large links. (
#191690
)
--gc-sections
mark phase is now parallelized. (
#189321
)
Relocation scanning was rewritten as target-specific scanners for
all targets with shared library support, devirtualizing the hot
relocation-classification path.
Added
--bp-compression-sort-section=<glob>[=<layout_priority>[=<match_priority>]]
,
replacing the old coarse
--bp-compression-sort
modes with a
way to split input sections into multiple compression groups, run
balanced partitioning independently per group, and leave out sections
that are poor candidates for BP. (
#185661
)
Added
-z memtag-{mode,heap,stack}
as generic
replacements for the Android-specific
--android-memtag-*
flags;
--android-memtag-note
keeps the Android-specific
memtag note opt-in. (
#188205
)
Unused space in executable output sections is now filled with trap
instructions, primarily for
-z separate-code
mode. (
#176845
)
.eh_frame_hdr
now supports the
DW_EH_PE_sdata8
encoding, auto-upgrading from
sdata4
when a table entry or the frame pointer exceeds the
32-bit range, instead of erroring out for large executables. (
#179089
)
vna_flags
is now set to
VER_FLG_WEAK
when
all undefined references to a version are weak, allowing glibc's dynamic
loader to warn instead of error when the version is missing at runtime.
(
#176673
)
.ltext.*
input sections are now merged into a single
.ltext
output section, matching the existing
.ldata.*
/
.lrodata.*
/
.lbss.*
handling for the large code model with
-ffunction-sections
.
(
#190305
)
.gnu.build.attributes.*
input sections are now
concatenated into one output section, matching GNU ld. (
#208737
)
.tbss
output sections may now use an explicit address
expression; previously it was silently overridden to follow the
preceding
.tbss
. (
#196447
)
--discard-locals
/
--discard-all
combined
with
-r
/
--emit-relocs
no longer discard local
symbols that are referenced only from retained
non-
SHF_ALLOC
sections (e.g.
.L
symbols
referenced by
.debug_info
), fixing DWARF corruption in the
output. (
#209035
) (
#209042
)
--retain-symbols-file
now filters
.symtab
instead of
.dynsym
, matching GNU ld. (
#209063
)
When
-o
is
-
, the output is written to the
lld::outs()
stream instead of the process's stdout, so that
library users can capture it. (
#209064
)
INCLUDE
in linker scripts now fully parses its own
content instead of sharing a lexer buffer stack with the includer,
fixing spurious acceptance of malformed scripts. (
#193427
)
The
OVERLAY
linker script command now accepts any
output-section-command (e.g. symbol assignments), not just input section
descriptions. (
#203524
)
Thunks are no longer reused across an
OVERLAY
boundary
unless the target output section is guaranteed to be resident at the
same time. (
#200415
)
When a
SECTIONS
command interleaves relro and non-relro
sections, lld now emits one
PT_GNU_RELRO
segment per
contiguous run of relro sections instead of reporting a
not contiguous with other relro sections
error. (
#203675
)
SHT_NOBITS
sections are now excluded from LMA overlap
checks, matching GNU ld and allowing e.g. a startup section to share an
LMA with
.bss
in embedded linker scripts. (
#196423
)
LTO: the middle-end no longer emits new references to, or
internalizes, symbols defined in bitcode after the extracted-bitcode set
has been fixed, preventing undefined symbol references from transforms
that run after linking has determined which bitcode files to extract.
(
#164916
)
DTLTO: significantly improved the performance of adding backend
output files to the link, especially on Windows. (
#186366
)
For AArch64, fixed
.relr.auth.dyn
->
.rela.dyn
movement to properly adjust
__rela_iplt_start
/
__rela_iplt_end
and size the
.dynamic
section for both tags. (
#195649
)
For AArch64, handle Memtag globals for
R_AARCH64_AUTH_ABS64
. (
#173291
)
For AArch64, fixed TLS GD against non-preemptible dynamic symbols
(e.g.
protected
or
-Bsymbolic
) in DSOs, which
previously produced an inconsistent GOT entry and spurious preemption.
(
#207881
)
For AArch64,
adrp
+
ldr
GOT relaxation is
now decided per-symbol, all-or-nothing, avoiding invalid relaxation when
a branch target sits between the
adrp
and
ldr
of a pair. (
#208396
)
For AArch64, a redundant local-exec TLS
add
with a zero
high-12-bits immediate is now relaxed to a
nop
. (
#204286
)
For AArch64,
-z bti-report=none
and
-z gcs-report=none
now silence the warnings implied by
-z force-bti
and
-z gcs=always
. (
#186343
)
For Hexagon, fixed out-of-range PLT branch thunks and TLS GD PLT
entry creation. (
#186545
) (
#180297
)
For LoongArch, fixed range checking of
R_LARCH_*_PCADD_HI20
relocations on 64-bit and DTPREL
relocations in debug sections. (
#183233
) (
#199327
)
For MIPS, fixed the addend for preemptible static TLS. (
#150729
)
For x86-64, CFI jump table relaxation reduces the runtime overhead
of indirect calls under Control Flow Integrity by opportunistically
moving eligible function bodies into the jump table itself. (
#147424
)
Breaking changes:
The symbol partition feature has been removed. lld no longer
recognizes
SHT_LLVM_SYMPART
sections, which are now treated
as ordinary sections. (
#198718
) (
#199186
)
An output section that has an address expression, and is also
assigned to a
MEMORY
region, now uses the address
expression in preference to the next available location in the region,
matching GNU ld. (
#197293
)
The default extension for time trace files is now
.time-trace.json
. (
#122207
)
Jessica Clarke (jrtc27) and Peter Smith (smithp35) continued to
contribute patches and reviews. jrtc27 fixed several TLS corner cases
(AArch64 TLS GD against non-preemptible symbols, MIPS static TLS
addends, SystemZ
R_390_TLS_LDO
in
non-
SHF_ALLOC
sections). Brian Cain fixed a batch of
Hexagon issues.
Performance
The parallelization work from the first half of 2026 all landed
before release/23.x was branched in July:
Parallel input file loading (
#191690
).
createFiles
records a job per non-script input, and
loadFiles
fans the jobs out to worker threads. Linker
scripts stay on the main thread since
INPUT()
/
GROUP()
recurse into the driver.
Parallel
--gc-sections
mark (
#189321
), a
level-synchronized BFS with per-shard queues. A follow-up replaced
parallel::getThreadIndex
with a shared counter and explicit
shards, which improved load balancing (
#208974
).
Relocation scanning is parallel for
-z nocombreloc
and
PPC64 as well (
#190309
);
only MIPS still scans serially.
Target-specific relocation scanning: each target's
scanSectionImpl
inlines
getRelExpr
and TLS
optimization dispatch. x86 (
#178846
),
AArch64 (
#181099
),
ARM (
#182440
),
RISC-V (
#181332
),
LoongArch (
#182236
),
Hexagon (
#181596
),
SystemZ (
#181563
),
PPC32 (
#181517
),
PPC64 (
#181496
),
and SPARCV9 (
#206284
).
Faster
getSectionPiece
for merge sections (
#187916
).
Parallel
demoteAndCopyLocalSymbols
(
#187970
) and
demoteSymbolsAndComputeIsPreemptible
(
#207310
),
parallel orphan output section name computation (
#207321
),
and reusing
SHT_GROUP
selection verdicts in
initializeSections
(
#207437
).
llvm/lib/Support/Parallel.cpp
improvements:
parallelFor
spawns only
ThreadCount
workers
that claim chunks with an atomic counter,
TaskGroup::spawn
avoids a mutex, the
Executor
virtual base class is gone,
and nested
TaskGroup
s use work stealing instead of
degenerating to serial execution.
Two of these needed extra care after they landed.
--reproduce
output became non-deterministic with parallel
loading, fixed in
#196773
.
handleTlsIe
could call the unsynchronized
addRelativeReloc
from concurrent scan tasks
(
R_386_TLS_IE
in
-shared
links), fixed in
#208956
; the
test was restructured so that a ThreadSanitizer build detects the
race.
Here is lld 22.1.8 versus lld 23.1 (release/23.x at 069ef0e7cb36) on
an Intel i7-14700K. Both were built with the same Clang at
-O3 -DNDEBUG
without assertions, as
-fPIE
code
in PIE executables with
-Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs
, and
both link against the system mimalloc 3.5 with
-lmimalloc
.
The workloads are from Rui Ueyama: nine x86-64 release-mode links
captured with
--reproduce
(Clang 21.1.8, Chromium 145,

libxul.so

, PyTorch

), linked with
--threads=8
,
pinned to the 8 performance cores, transparent huge pages enabled,
output written to tmpfs,
hyperfine -w 2 -r 10
. The debug
bundles have 13-19 GiB of input and were I/O bound on this machine, so I
left them out.

lld 23.1 is 1.04x to 1.23x as fast as lld 22.1 on these links. The
two slowest links are each dominated by a single phase according to
--time-trace
. On TensorFlow,
Process symbol versions
takes 4.5 s of the 5.6 s link: the
version script has 29
*pattern*
globs, and each wildcard
pattern is matched against every symbol on one thread. On Chromium,
--icf=all
takes 2.7 s of the 4.2 s link.
For the full breakdown, including comparisons with mold and wild, see
Recent
lld/ELF performance improvements
.
Note:
libtensorflow_cc.so
exhibits a low speedup due to
slow version script handling, which will be optimized in the next
release.
CFI jump table relaxation
Clang's Control-Flow Integrity (
-fsanitize=cfi-icall
and
friends) implements indirect call checks with jump tables. For every
address-taken function
f
, the
LowerTypeTests
pass renames the body to
f.cfi
and creates a jump table
entry
f
that is just
jmp f.cfi
. Functions with
the same type signature get consecutive entries, so checking that an
indirect call target has the expected type is a range and alignment
check on the address. The address-taken symbol
f
refers to
the jump table entry, not the body.
On x86-64 each entry is 8 bytes (a 5-byte
jmp
padded
with
int3
):
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
.section .text.cfi.jumptable,"ax",@llvm_cfi_jump_table,8
f:
jmp f.cfi
int3; int3; int3
g:
jmp g.cfi
int3; int3; int3
h:
jmp h.cfi
int3; int3; int3
Every indirect call pays an extra
jmp
, and the jump
tables are clustered together, typically far from the callees, which
hurts the i-cache and the iTLB. Google's internal benchmarking
attributed around 30% of the total CFI overhead to this indirection. lld
21 added
--branch-to-branch
(enabled at
-O2
),
which retargets a direct
call f
to
f.cfi
(
#145579
),
but indirect calls still went through the table.
lld 23 adds CFI jump table relaxation (
#147424
),
also controlled by
--branch-to-branch
. LLVM 22 defined a
new section type
SHT_LLVM_CFI_JUMP_TABLE
with
sh_entsize
set to the entry size, and Clang 23 emits CFI
jump tables with this type.
X86_64::relaxCFIJumpTables
walks such sections and eliminates the indirection in two cases:
If
f.cfi
is at most
sh_entsize
bytes (and
no more aligned than that), the function body is moved into the jump
table in place of the entry. The jump table is split into slices around
the moved bodies.
The last entry's target is handled specially: the jump table is
placed immediately before the target function, and the last
jmp
is deleted so that control falls through. The function
stays where it is, on the assumption that functions of the same type
(and their callees) are more likely to share a page with each other than
with the jump table's original location.
The eligibility check is conservative: the branch must be a
R_X86_64_PC32
/
R_X86_64_PLT32
to the start of a
non-preemptible, non-IFUNC
Defined
symbol, the section may
not be over-aligned relative to the entry size, and a function body is
only moved once even if multiple jump tables reference it. The commit
message reports a 0.2 to 0.5 percentage point reduction in CFI overhead
(10-25% of the overhead) on a large internal Google benchmark.
Symbol partitions removed
The symbol partition feature (2019,
D60242
and
D60353
) allowed an executable
or shared object to be split into a main partition and several loadable
partitions. Symbols were assigned to partitions with
SHT_LLVM_SYMPART
sections,
llvm-objcopy --extract-partition
extracted each partition
into a separate file, and the loader could
dlopen
a feature
partition on demand, sharing the main partition's memory. It was built
for Chrome on Android to lazily load features.
The feature touched a surprising amount of the linker: per-partition
MarkLive
runs, per-partition
.dynamic
/
.dynsym
/
.gnu.hash
/
.eh_frame
/
.ARM.exidx
,
cross-partition pull in
InputSection::replace
, thunk
compatibility checks,
PartitionIndexSection
, and more.
Chrome hasn't needed it for years, and I am not aware of any other user.
#198718
reduced the machinery to a shim, and
#199186
removed the rest.
SHT_LLVM_SYMPART
sections are now treated
as ordinary sections, and
ctx.mainPart
/
ctx.partitions
are gone from the
code base.
Removing an experimental feature that never found a second user
simplifies a lot of code paths, particularly synthetic sections, which
no longer need to be instantiated per partition.
Linker script robustness
Several linker script fixes landed this cycle.
INCLUDE
used to push a buffer onto the lexer's buffer
stack, so a construct started in the included file could be closed by
the parent. This accepted malformed scripts (a missing
;
in
the include, terminated by the parent's
;
) and computed
undefined-behavior spans in
readAssignment
.
#193427
makes each
INCLUDE
parse its own content like a call frame;
the top-level,
SECTIONS
, output section, and
MEMORY
call sites pass a context-appropriate parser
callback.
OVERLAY
now accepts any output-section-command, e.g.
symbol assignments, not just input section descriptions (
#203524
).
Thunks in an
OVERLAY
are no longer reused by callers in a
different output section, since the thunk may not be resident when the
caller runs (
#200415
).
Peter Smith notes that Tightly Coupled Memory regions could be modeled
the same way.
When a
SECTIONS
command interleaves relro and non-relro
sections, lld used to error with
not contiguous with other relro sections
(
D40359
). glibc only honors
the first
PT_GNU_RELRO
, but Bionic and FreeBSD rtld protect
every
PT_GNU_RELRO
segment, so
#203675
emits one
PT_GNU_RELRO
per contiguous run of relro
sections. Each relro-to-non-relro transition still starts a fresh
PT_LOAD
.
SHT_NOBITS
sections are excluded from LMA overlap checks
(
#196423
),
matching GNU ld, which lets embedded scripts place a startup section at
the same load address as
.bss
.
The
MEMORY
change is worth calling out as a behavior
change. For
s02 . : { ... } > FLASH
, lld evaluated
.
against the memory region's current position instead of
the global location counter.
#197293
fixes this to match GNU ld. If you relied on the old behavior, the
section address may move.
GNU ld compatibility
--retain-symbols-file
was implemented in 2017 using the
symbol version machinery (
{local: *; global: listed;}
),
which removed unlisted symbols from
.dynsym
and left
.symtab
untouched. GNU ld does the opposite: it keeps only
the listed symbols in
.symtab
and does not touch
.dynsym
.
#209063
reimplements the option on top of the
--discard-{locals,all}
mechanism. Use
--export-dynamic-symbol
or a version script to control
.dynsym
.
While reworking
--discard-*
, I found that
-r
/
--emit-relocs
with
--discard-locals
could discard
.L
symbols
referenced only from retained non-
SHF_ALLOC
sections (e.g.
.debug_str_offsets
referenced by
.debug_info
),
rewriting the relocations to reference the null symbol and corrupting
DWARF (
#209042
).
This is common on RISC-V, where the assembler prefers symbol-relative
relocations, but reachable on any target with
--reloc-section-sym=none
.
.gnu.build.attributes.*
sections (emitted by annobin)
are now concatenated into
.gnu.build.attributes
(
#208737
).
GNU ld has done this since 2018; without it, an output with tens of
thousands of sections broke tools like
file
.
vna_flags
is set to
VER_FLG_WEAK
when all
undefined references to a version are weak (
#176673
).
glibc since 2.30 tolerates a missing versioned symbol when the shared
object defines the version; with this flag it also tolerates a
completely missing version, printing
weak version 'v1' not found
instead of failing. This is
useful for optional dependencies.
AI-assisted patches
The commit count is only part of the story. Excluding my own and the
backport bot's, 147 pull requests carried the
lld:ELF
label
between the two branch points, compared with 99 in the 22 cycle; 82
people opened one, up from 49, and 49 of them had not sent an lld/ELF
patch before. Many of the new contributors are unfamiliar with lld and
use coding agents, and a large fraction of these patches were of poor
quality.
Some marks are unmistakable: "Initial plan", multiple headings, agent
trailers, a
copilot/...
branch, and a first CI run that
fails on a missing
#include
because the patch was never
compiled locally.
Most are subtler, and the patches fall into a few kinds.
Wrong root cause
The agent finds the place where the symptom can be suppressed and
adds a special case there, complete with a plausible test, while the
actual bug lives elsewhere. Explaining why the fix belongs somewhere
else takes longer than writing the right fix, so several times this
cycle I closed the pull request, fixed the issue myself, and (depending
on the concrete scenario) credited the original PR link/author in the
commit message.
Real issue, fine fix, but super verbose description or bad
tests
... the commit message is four times longer than it needs to be, the
comments restate the code beneath them, and a new test file is added
where an existing test could have been extended by two lines.
Feature-sized patch that skipped a design
discussion
The tool makes it easy to produce a thousand lines that look like lld
code, but the hard part is the design discussion, and that part can't be
delegated.
I don't object to the tools; I used Claude Code to draft this post.
The problem is what they do to the social system around code. The cost
shifts from the contributor to the maintainer. The effort it took to
write a patch used to be a commitment signal; reviewing generated code
that its author only half understands removes the fun part and keeps the
exhausting part.
Unless you are the BDFL, the social norm is still "mentor, don't
rewrite their patch". That norm made sense when a patch represented
hours of work. It doesn't now, and it hasn't adapted.
For a component maintained as volunteer work, maintainer time is the
bottleneck, and LLVM's
AI tool use policy
calls such patches extractive contributions for a reason.
If you are new to LLVM, start with unaided or lightly aided patches
on small, well-scoped issues: extend an existing test rather than adding
a file, run tests before posting, and keep the commit message
proportional to the change. A track record on small work is the fastest
route to using agents productively on larger changes later.
