# Avoid Public Functions Calling Other Public Functions

Avoid Public Functions Calling Other Public Functions
Oct 29, 2026
A small-scale rule of thumb. This article will land much better with a concrete
example, but I am drawing a blank here, so you gotta just blindly trust my say
so!
When implementing a software module, it’s often a case that you are writing a
public function
foo
, and at least part of what
foo
does is already handled
by another public function
bar
. The DRY instinct encourages you to call
bar()
from within
foo
. This usually creates problems down the line. Instead,
create a new
private
function and refactor both
foo
and
bar
to call that
shared helper:
pub
fn
foo
()
void
{
return
bar(.{ .frobnicate =
true
});
}
pub
fn
bar
(options:
struct
{
frobnicate:
bool
=
false
,
})
void
{
}
pub
fn
foo
()
void
{
return
helper(.frobnicate);
}
pub
fn
bar
()
void
{
return
helper(.transmogrify);
}
fn
helper
(mode:
enum
{ frobnicate, transmogrify })
void
{
}
Rationale: the goal of a public API is to provide an interface that works best
at the call site. If parts of public API are re-used to implement the rest of
the API, then there’s a tension between making the interface convenient for the
outside user and making it convenient to use from within abstraction itself.
Namely, functions tend to grow optional parameters that should never be set by
the user. Crucially, the parameter growth and interface degradation can happen
after
the original code sharing.
By proactively making the shared implementation private, the tension is defused.
You still might need to tinker with
helper
signature until it does everything
it needs to do, but, because the helper is private, this is a cheap, local
change.
A notable exception to this rule of thumb are “shortcut” APIs, where a public
function is
defined
as a commonly used chain of calls to other public
functions. There, the rule is the opposite —
no
private calls are allowed,
to make sure that it is a genuine shortcut, and not a midlayer mistake.
P.S. While researching if anyone wrote a better blog post already, I stumbled
upon a fun stack overflow question, asking, paraphrasing:
I’ve heard that it is bad when a public function calls another public
function. Is this really so?
The most upvoted answer explains that it is indeed bad, because this makes
mocking to test a single method in isolation more complicated. Which is, imo, a
natural, but horrible consequence of misguided approach to testing. You
shouldn’t be mocking your methods, you should mock your IO. And, similarly, you
shouldn’t test methods, but rather software functionality (unless you are
building a public library with a stable API, which is a fun and important, but
very narrow fraction of software development).
The accepted answer says that this recommendation makes no sense if it is not
backed by an industry wide or an organizational standard. Which somehow manages
to make even less sense — you shouldn’t follow the guideline rules because
they are written in sanctified ink! Rather, you should apply each particular
rule because of the underlying reasons that motivate the rule. Guidelines and
best practices articles can concentrate lots of good reasoning in a single
place, but they don’t absolve you from thinking!
