# how i write blog posts

Source: https://jyn.dev/how-i-write-blog-posts/

this isn’t about about blogging engines, don’t worry. there’s already plenty of writing about those. i use zola, i am mildly dissatisfied with it, i don’t care enough to switch.
no, this is how i actually write. i have an um.
eccentric
setup. in particular, i can write draft posts from any of my devices—desktop, laptop, phone—and have them show up live on a hidden subdomain of jyn.dev without any special work on my part.
how does this work? i’m glad you asked.
on my desktop, i have Caddy running a reverse proxy back to a live zola server. Caddy gives me nice things like https, and makes me less worried about having public ports on the internet.
to get live-reloading working, Caddy also reverse-proxies websockets.
on my desktop, i have the zola content/ directory sym-linked to a subdirectory of my obsidian notes folder.
on all my devices, i run Obsidian Sync in the background, which automatically syncs my posts everywhere. it costs $5/month and doesn’t cause me trouble, which is a lot more than i can say for most technology.
on laptop and mobile, i just write in obsidian, like i would for any other notes. i have a "blog post" template that inserts the zola header; otherwise i just write normal markdown.
when i’m ready to publish, i commit the changes to git on desktop or laptop and push to github, which updates the public facing blog.
works great!
normally i write outlines and ideas down on mobile, and then clean them up into prose on desktop. when i edit on desktop, i sometimes use nvim (e.g. for posts like
how i use my terminal
that have complicated html fragments). unlike obsidian, nvim doesn't have autosave, so i
added it myself
:
local
timers
=
{
}
function
autosave_enable
(
)
local
buf
=
vim
.
api
.
nvim_get_current_buf
(
)
if
timers
[
buf
]
then
return
end
local
buf_name
=
vim
.
fn
.
expand
'
%
'
vim
.
notify
(
"
autosaving
"
..
buf_name
)
timers
[
buf
]
=
vim
.
api
.
nvim_create_autocmd
(
"
CursorHold
"
,
{
desc
=
"
Save
"
..
buf_name
..
"
on change
"
,
callback
=
function
(
)
vim
.
api
.
nvim_buf_call
(
buf
,
function
(
)
vim
.
cmd
"
silent update
"
end
)
end
}
)
end
vim
.
api
.
nvim_create_user_command
(
'
AutoSave
'
,
autosave_enable
,
{
desc
=
"
Start saving each second on change
"
}
)
the Caddyfile is also quite simple:
subdomain.jyn.dev
{
reverse_proxy
localhost:1111
{
fail_duration
10s
}
handle_errors
502 503
{
header
Content-Type text/html
respond
503
{
body
"<!doctype html><html><body>subdomain.jyn.dev is down right n
ow; DM jyn to bring it back up. or just visit <a href='https://jyn.dev'>jyn.dev</a>.</b
ody></html>"
}
}
}
subdomain.jyn.dev:1025
{
reverse_proxy
localhost:1024 {}
}
the one downside of this is that i get very little visibility on mobile onto why things are not syncing to the desktop. to make up for this, my phone and desktop are on the same
tailnet
, which allows me to ssh in remotely to check up on the zola server (i’ve never had to check up on the Caddy server). i like
Termius
for this.
note some things about this setup:
i have live reloading all the way through, regardless of the editor or device i am using to edit the post.
because it's just a public url, it's very easy to share with my friends and ask for feedback on early posts, without making the posts visible to random people on hacker news.
if i ever want to take down the site, i just kill the zola server. it defaults to off when i start my computer.
