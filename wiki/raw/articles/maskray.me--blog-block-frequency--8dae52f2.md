# Block frequency | MaskRay

Source: https://maskray.me/blog/block-frequency

Estimating branch
probabilities
says how one branch splits.
BlockFrequencyInfo
turns those local numbers into per-block
frequencies, which nearly every profitability decision in LLVM ends up
reading.
The core is a linear-time propagation over loop-packaged regions.
Where no such structure exists — irreducible control flow — the accuracy
goes with it.
What it produces
getBlockFreq(BB)
returns a
BlockFrequency
,
a bare
uint64_t
with no unit.
finalizeMetrics
rescales each function so that its
hottest
block lands on
2⁵⁴.

- entry: float = 1.0,  int = 562949953421312     <- 2^49
- loop:  float = 32.0, int = 18014398509481984   <- 2^54
- exit:  float = 1.0,  int = 562949953421312
block-frequency-info: flat
- entry: float = 1.0,  int = 18014398509481984   <- 2^54

- b:     float = 0.5,  int = 9007199254740992
The two printed columns do not share a reference:
float
is the frequency with the
entry
at 1.0,
int
is the
same frequency with the
hottest block
at 2⁵⁴.
MachineBlockFrequencyInfo::getBlockFreqRelativeToEntryBlock
divides by
getEntryFreq()
to recover the entry-relative
ratio, which is the whole of what register allocation weights a spill
by. Turning a frequency into a count needs a profile as well:
1
count(BB) = entryCount × freq(BB) / freq(entry)
getProfileCountFromFreq
returns nothing when the
function carries no entry count — which is how
isHotBlock
and the rest degrade to "unknown" rather than to "cold".
2⁵⁴ rather than
UINT64_MAX
because consumers add
frequencies up and multiply them by instruction costs, and
Slack = 10
leaves room before those saturate. At the other
end every block is floored at 1: the coldest-to-hottest range rarely
fits in 64 bits, and the comment says outright that the precision is
spent on the hot end.
Until
finalizeMetrics
runs, a frequency is a
Scaled64
—
ScaledNumber<uint64_t>
, a
software float with a 64-bit significand and an exponent. Loop scales
compose multiplicatively, so the range runs far past anything a fraction
of one could hold; the integers above are the last step, not the working
representation.
Mass, packaging, scale
BFI propagates mass one loop level at a time. The scheme is the
propagation half of Wu and Larus,
Static Branch Frequency and
Program Profile Analysis
(MICRO-27, 1994), though nothing in the
tree cites it.
Blocks are numbered in reverse post-order, and a
BlockNode
's index
is
its RPO index — which
is why later code can test edge direction with a plain
<
.

compute(F):
for L in loop forest of F, innermost first:
sweep(L)
L.scale = 1 / (1 - L.BackedgeMass)
package L: one pseudo-node reusing its header's RPO number,
whose successors are the exits sweep(L) recorded
sweep(F)                                 # every loop is a single node by now
freq = mass                              # each block's mass within its innermost region
for L in loop forest of F, outermost first:
scale = L.scale * freq[L.package]      # final already; read before the writes below
for b in members(L):
freq[b] = mass[b] * scale
# members(R) are R's *immediate* members, in RPO order.  A nested loop contributes
# exactly one node, its package, never its blocks.  For the function that means every
# block outside any loop, plus one node per top-level loop.

mass[entry of R] = 1
for b in members(R):
for (b -> s, w) in succWeights(b):     # a package reports its recorded exits
m = mass[b] * w / total weight out of b
if s is R's header:   R.BackedgeMass += m
elif s is outside R:  R.Exits += (s, m)
else:                 mass[s] += m
sweep
runs on a DAG and computes
mass[b]
,
the probability that a walk from the header passes through
b
. A backedge deposits into
BackedgeMass
instead of being followed and every sub-loop is already a single node,
so RPO is a topological order there and one pass suffices:
O(V+E)
. GCC's
propagate_freq
instead re-walks
each block once per loop depth,
O(V·D)
.
Mass is therefore a fraction of one, and the
1
above is
a
BlockMass
: a
uint64_t
in which
BlockMass::getFull()
—
UINT64_MAX
— is that
one. Fixed point, so a split across successors recombines exactly;
distributeMass
dithers the remainder, an even split of full
mass giving
8000000000000000
and
7fffffffffffffff
, which add back to
ffffffffffffffff
. Distribution stays exact; the scales, and
the frequencies built from them, are
Scaled64
.
The scale is the geometric series: return 90% of the mass to the
header and the loop runs 10 times.
What makes this sound is that a natural loop's header is its
only
way in. All mass enters there, so each member's mass comes
out a fixed multiple of the header's, determined by the branch
probabilities alone. The loop's internal shape and its scale are settled
without knowing anything outside it, and
unwrapLoops
supplies the header's real frequency afterwards — one multiplication,
applied to a shape that never needed revising.
An irreducible loop has no such invariant. Mass enters at several
blocks at once, and the members' relative frequencies depend on how it
splits among those entries — a ratio fixed by the enclosing region, not
by the SCC.
Irreducible loops
A natural loop is a strongly connected component with one way in, its
header. An SCC with two or more entries is
irreducible
. It is
packaged like a loop — the lowest-RPO member stands for the package and
donates its RPO number — and
solveIrreducibleMass
settles
the members instead.
The routine is up against one missing number: inside the region the
frequencies solve
with
P
the intra-SCC probabilities and
e
the mass arriving from outside at each entry. Packaging is bottom-up:
the SCC has to collapse to a single node before the enclosing region is
swept, because that sweep is only valid on a DAG — but
e
is
what that sweep produces. At solve time it does not exist yet. A natural
loop does not care, its
e
being a scalar on the one header;
an irreducible SCC's is a distribution over its entries, and its shape
is part of the answer.
So the solve drops
e
. It starts
F
uniform
over the members and iterates
F ← F·P
, converging towards
π
, the dominant left eigenvector of
P
: the
shape the SCC settles into after circulating a long time, whichever way
the entry mass split. Members carrying
!irr_loop_header_weight
— PGO metadata recording a measured
frequency for an irreducible header — are held fixed instead, and the
rest settle around them.
What that gives up shows in the true solution. Expand it as a series,
where term
k
is the mass that came in through the entries
and has since gone round the SCC
k
times. Split
e
along the eigenvectors of
P
—
e = c₁π + c₂e₂ + ⋯
, with
λᵢ
the eigenvalue
belonging to
eᵢ
— and that series collapses:
1
2
f = e(I − P)⁻¹ = e + e·P + e·P² + ⋯
= c₁·π/(1−λ₁) + c₂·e₂/(1−λ₂) + ⋯
λ₁ is the largest eigenvalue, so π gets the largest weight; an SCC
that circulates many times before exiting has λ₁ near 1 and is almost
entirely that term, which is what makes π a reasonable thing to aim at.
What aiming at it misses is the head of the series: the first term is
e
itself, the mass that leaves without going round at all,
and it dominates whenever most mass exits after a lap or two. So the
solve is exact when
e
already points along π and decays as
it tilts away — a condition on direction, not on balance, which is why
entries of equal frequency are neither necessary nor sufficient.
The error does not stay inside the package either, because
F
also decides how much mass leaves. Each exit edge
contributes
F[i]
times its probability, those contributions
sum to the package's exit mass, and the loop scale is its reciprocal.
Weight a block that exits readily where the truth weights one that
circulates, and the exit mass comes out too large, so the scale comes
out too small and every block in the package is uniformly that much too
cold. Those same contributions are the exits the package hands its
parent, so the distortion travels outward too —
yyparse_1
below is that failure at 276×, landing on the enclosing loop.
The iteration is bounded rather than run to convergence:
1
2
const
unsigned
MaxIterations =
16
;
A periodic SCC oscillates forever — 10 of 38 in one corpus were still
moving at 100000 iterations. Sweeping the bound leaves the error
distribution unchanged from 10 iterations to 1000, and not monotonically
— 20 scores better than 30 — so the iterate wanders rather than steadily
improving and the tail is noise. Cost per SCC of
m
internal
edges goes
O(m)
→
O(k·m)
with
k ≤ 16
, bounded by the SCC rather than by the function.
The solve also inherits circulation that never becomes a loop scale.
Since
#213488
the
forest BFI wants is a strict subset of the cycle forest:
initializeLoops
does not represent a reducible cycle whose
header is an
entry
of an enclosing irreducible cycle, so that
equal entries stay equal:
1
entry -> a | b        a -> c | b        c -> a        b -> a | exit
{a,c}
is a natural loop headed by
a
, and
a
is an entry of
{a,b,c}
, so
-debug-only=block-freq
prints no
- loop =
line
for it and its ~32× trip count never arrives as a scale; all of it has
to come out of the solve.
All three nestings occur, but only two survive into the packaging. An
irreducible SCC inside a natural loop is the ordinary case and both are
represented, the SCC packaged first and given its own scale. A natural
loop inside an irreducible SCC is also packaged first, so it enters the
IrreducibleGraph
as a single node — unless
hasLoop
dropped it, as above. An irreducible cycle inside
an irreducible cycle nests freely in the forest, three deep here:
1
entry -> a | b        a -> c        b -> d        c -> d | a        d -> c | b
but
analyzeIrreducible
takes
maximal
SCCs and a
nested irreducible cycle lies inside the same one, so all of it comes
out as a single flat package — one power iteration over every member,
with none of the inner structure surviving as a scale.
Members are still classified, by
analyzeIrreducible
running Tarjan over an
IrreducibleGraph
— the CFG
restricted to the enclosing loop, quotiented by packaged sub-loops, cut
at the enclosing header:

set
(V);
if
(!IsEntry[U] && SccId[V] == SccId[U] && !(U.Node < V->Node))
Extra.
set
(V);
Extra headers
are internal cycles that would
otherwise wrap back past an already-swept block; the
!IsEntry[U]
guard keeps a retreating edge
from
an
entry from creating one, entries having no meaningful relative order.
Since the solve treats all members alike, the split now survives only to
decide
isIrrLoopHeader()
, where PGO instrumentation places
its counters.
Almost none of these regions are written by anyone. Tail duplication
replicates a computed-goto interpreter dispatch, each copy becomes
another entry into the same cycle, and the SCC ends up as wide as the
dispatch table: 22 of 221703 functions at MIR against 3 of 64391 at
IR.
Measuring it
For a region with an exit, frequencies are the unique solution of
f = e + fP
, where
P
holds the branch
probabilities and
e
is the
entry injection
— the
mass arriving from outside the region; for a closed region only ratios
are defined, and the answer is the stationary distribution of
P
. Both are small exact rational solves: scrape
print<branch-prob>
for the probabilities, eliminate
over
fractions.Fraction
, compare against
print<block-freq>
.
Two traps in the comparison. Filter blocks below ~
1e-6
of the hottest — BPI's weight-1 floor manufactures
1e-19
blocks that otherwise dominate every relative error. And do not
renormalize
P
's rows to stochastic in order to compare
ratios when the region has a real exit; that changes the object being
solved, and will report an improvement as a regression.

and the residual is the missing

under the class's known flaws: partially compute mass in the parent loop
and stop at the SCC, which gives the correct ratio of entry masses;
compute mass in the SCC, then continue in the parent.
Damping (
F ← (F + F·P)/2
) would fix the oscillation and
converges in a median of 32 steps, but it converges
towards
the
quasi-stationary vector, which is the wrong target while the injection
is missing: it turns three exact cases into 1.24–1.41× to buy one
improvement.
Until August 2026 there was no solve. BFI invented a header, as the
file's comment said:
Block frequency calculations act as if a block is inserted that
intercepts all the edges to the headers. All backedges and entries point
to this block. Its successors are the headers, which split the frequency
evenly.
Entries and extras were sorted
together
into a header prefix
of
LoopData::Nodes
, so
isHeader
was a binary
search and
getHeaderIndex
a
lower_bound
. The
primary entry was
Nodes[0]
, the lowest-RPO header — and
because of that joint sort it might well be an extra header rather than
a real entry.
Mass reached the headers in four steps. Full mass was
seeded
across them by
!irr_loop_header_weight
, or by
MinHeaderWeight
for headers lacking it (the minimum, the comment noted, beats the
average), or evenly when no metadata existed at all. Every node was
swept
, headers included. Any edge to any header
accumulated
into a per-header
BackedgeMass
vector, indexed by
getHeaderIndex
. Finally
adjustLoopHeaderMass
corrected
, but only
if no header had metadata: it discarded the seeded split and
redistributed full mass in proportion to the backedge mass each header
actually received.
That correction was the entire approximation —
one step of
power iteration
, seeded from uniform, never repeated, and
skipped outright when a profile was present.
unequalrows
at
4.000 against an exact 2.667 is precisely what one such step from an
even split gives.
#215170
packaged the SCC with a single representative and solved it instead.
NumHeaders
, the sorted prefix,
getHeaderIndex
,
distributeIrrLoopHeaderMass

adjustLoopHeaderMass
and
MinHeaderWeight
all
went;
isHeader
collapsed to

and the per-header
BackedgeMass
vector to a scalar, at net
−80 lines.

On a tail-duplicated computed-goto dispatch — the shape irreducible
CFGs actually take in the wild — worst-block error went 1.536× →
1.003×.
Relaxing the whole function
LLVM carries a second solver for the same system, behind
-use-iterative-bfi-inference
and gated on profile data plus
an irreducible loop. It relaxes
f = e + fP
over the whole
function, where the entry mass
is
known — so unlike the SCC
solve it has a fixed point to converge to, not merely a direction.
Where both apply, inference wins. On
yyparse_1
(
Transforms/SampleProfile/profile-correlation-irreducible-loops.ll
),
the function whose comment says inference exists to fix it, relative to
b1
:
1
2
3
4
exact    solve only    + inference
b2       586.19       2.1256            586
b3       585.78       1.1267            586
b4       585.19       1.1256            585
Most of that gap is the missing injection arriving as a wrong scale,
one level out from where it was made. The SCC is packaged as
b7**
inside a natural loop headed by
b2
, and
the exits recorded for that package — read off
F
— decide
how much of the loop's mass escapes instead of returning to
b2
.
compute-loop-scale
then puts the
loop's
exit mass at 0.4705 of full against a true 1/586.19 =
0.0017, so 276× too much leaves per iteration, and the trip count is its
reciprocal:
b2
prints 2.1256 where the truth is 586.19. An
error made inside the package is charged to the region enclosing it. The
shape largely survives —
b3
:
b4
comes out
1.0010 against an exact 1.0010 — and what is off is the scale everything
is multiplied by.
The two stack rather than compete, because inference starts from
BFI's own output: it is a refinement seeded by
getFloatingBlockFreq
, so a better seed is worth iterations.
Over the corpus above, enabling inference takes the functions within 10%
of exact from 118 to 137 before the SCC solve, and from 129 to 144
after.
On accuracy alone, though, inference dominates at any budget.
-iterative-bfi-max-iterations-per-block=K
buys K sweeps; on
800 generated ~100-block functions with small embedded irreducible
cycles, counting those whose worst block lands within 1% of exact:
1

K = 16                545        552
K = 1000              756        761
Down a column, one sweep already beats the solve — inference solves
the system where the solve recovers a direction. Across the columns, the
solve is the better seed at every capped budget and a wash by
convergence.
Granularity is what keeps them from being redundant. Inference's
smallest purchase is one relaxation pass over the whole reachable
function; the solve's is one power iteration over the cycle. On
sqlite3WhereBegin
at
-O3
— 985 blocks and 1651
edges around one irreducible cycle of 22 blocks and 42 edges — the
solve's
entire
budget is 16 × 42 = 672 multiply-adds against
1651 for a single sweep. Below one sweep there is nothing to buy but the
solve — and the default budget does not converge either: that function
runs 985001 updates, exactly the 1000-per-block cap, stopping at a
discrepancy of 8.8e-4 against a 1e-12 target.
Shape separates them too:
initTransitionProbabilities
routes sinks back to the entry, so the chain it solves is closed, and
where a function has
no
exit blocks — the computed-goto
dispatch again — inference is a no-op. That holds even after forcing its
hasProfileData
gate open, so it is the missing exits, not
the gate.
Two defects sit in that same routine. It drops parallel edges rather
than summing their probabilities, and discards zero-probability jumps,
so the chain it converges to is not the one the CFG describes — enough
to move a generated corpus's median error from 4.6× to 16.2× once the
generator stresses both. And
findReachableBlocks
excludes
blocks that cannot reach a sink, which is
right
— a reachable
closed SCC has unbounded expected visits, and
f = e + fP
has no finite solution there — but those blocks are then assigned
Scaled64::getZero()
, so an ordinary reducible
while (1)
, the hottest block in its function, reports 0
because an irreducible loop exists elsewhere. Declining an ill-posed
question is correct; answering it with zero is not.
Priorities follow from the
yyparse_1
row: getting it
exact needs the flow equations solved, not a better eigenvector for one
SCC — an argument for the entry-injection work, visiting SCCs in
topological order and handing each the mass its entries actually
receive, over anything else described here.
Detecting irreducibility up
front
BFI used to discover which regions need this by failing. Distribution
ran until
addToDist
hit a retreating local edge to a
non-header, then aborted, packaged, and reran — which is why
IrreducibleGraph::addNode
resets each node's mass as a side
effect of building the graph. CycleInfo already knows, so
#214941
marks the regions while
initializeLoops
walks the cycle
forest and packages them before distributing.
What not to do
Sourcing the SCC decomposition from CycleInfo rather than running
Tarjan over
IrreducibleGraph
looks obvious and is not worth
it.
The graph is not the CFG — it is quotiented by packaged sub-loops and
cut at the enclosing header, without which the entire loop is one SCC
and nothing decomposes. More decisively, the order is load-bearing:
packages are created in reverse-topological order and siblings interact,
since an edge into a sibling resolves to its raw block if it is not yet
packaged but to its header if it is. 7.8% of irreducible regions contain
two or more SCCs, so this is common, not a corner case, and restoring
the order needs a topological sort of the SCC DAG — the thing just
deleted.
Extra
headers also still need the intra-SCC RPO
scan, which CycleInfo cannot answer.
What CycleInfo
can
answer is "does this region contain an
irreducible cycle" — which is exactly the detection above.
