# I want to become a Claude architect (full course)

To become a Claude Architect and develop production-grade applications you need to understand Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, Claude API, and Model Context Protocols, this article will help you learn everything and is based on the following exam.

However, as you can clearly see to get this "certified" you need to be a claude partner, otherwise, you cannot take this exam.
BUT DOES THAT EVEN MATTER?
If you have the ability to learn what it takes to become a "Claude Certified Architect" then you're able to build production-grade applications.
You don't need the certificate to build production-grade applications.
You just need the knowledge.
So I tore apart the entire exam guide and pulled out what actually matters so that you can become a Claude architect.

WHAT YOU ARE WALKING INTO:
The exam, which you won't be able to take unless you're a Claude partner, but that doesn't matter, because learning what you need for this exam will teach you on the following, so don't be a massive wet wipe saying "you fooled me" because you don't get to take the actual exam for just a gay tick mark, be a self-learner and become a Claude architect by UNDERSTANDING the following as the exam would test you on: Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, Claude API, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).
WHICH ARE ALL SKILLS YOU CAN MONETISE.

The exam would mean you need to learn the following:
Customer Support Resolution Agent (Agent SDK + MCP + escalation)
Code Generation with Claude Code (CLAUDE.md + plan mode + slash commands)
Multi-Agent Research System (coordinator-subagent orchestration)
Developer Productivity Tools (built-in tools + MCP servers)
Claude Code for CI/CD (non-interactive pipelines + structured output)
Structured Data Extraction (JSON schemas + tool_use + validation loops)

DOMAIN 1: AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE & ORCHESTRATION (27%).
The exam tests three anti-patterns you need to reject on sight: parsing natural language to determine loop termination, arbitrary iteration caps as the primary stopping mechanism, and checking for assistant text as a completion indicator. All wrong.
The single biggest mistake: people assume subagents share memory with the coordinator. They do not. Subagents operate with isolated context. Every piece of information must be passed explicitly in the prompt.
The rule that will save you the most marks: when stakes are financial or security-critical, prompt instructions alone are not enough. You must be enforcing tool ordering programmatically with hooks and prerequisite gates.
Where to learn this:
Agent SDK Overview for agentic loop mechanics and subagent patterns
Building Agents with the Claude Agent SDK for Anthropic's own best practices on hooks, orchestration, and sessions
Agent SDK Python repo + examples for hands-on code: hooks, custom tools, fork_session
What to build to learn: A multi-tool agent with 3-4 MCP tools, proper stop_reason handling, a PostToolUse hook normalising data formats, and a tool call interception hook blocking policy violations. This single exercise covers most of Domain 1.

DOMAIN 2: TOOL DESIGN & MCP INTEGRATION (18%)
Tool descriptions are incredibly overlooked bro, and the exam wants to test you on it.
Tool descriptions are the primary mechanism Claude uses for tool selection. If yours are vague or overlapping, selection becomes unreliable.
One sample question presents get_customer and lookup_order with near-identical descriptions causing constant misrouting. The correct fix is not few-shot examples, not a routing classifier, not tool consolidation. The fix is better descriptions.
Know the tool_choice options cold: "auto" (model might return text), "any" (must call a tool, picks which), forced selection (must call a specific tool). Know when each applies.
Giving an agent 18 tools degrades selection reliability. Scope each subagent to 4-5 tools relevant to its role.
Where to learn this:
MCP Integration for Claude Code for server scoping, environment variable expansion, project vs user config
MCP specification and community servers for understanding the protocol and knowing when to use community servers vs custom builds
Claude Agent SDK TypeScript repo for tool definition patterns and structured error responses
What to build: Two MCP tools with intentionally similar functionality. Write descriptions vague enough to cause misrouting. Then fix them. Experience the difference.

DOMAIN 3: CLAUDE CODE CONFIGURATION & WORKFLOWS (20%)
This separates people who use Claude Code from people who have configured it for a team.
The CLAUDE.md hierarchy is critical. Three levels: user-level (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md), project-level (.claude/CLAUDE.md), directory-level (subdirectory files). The exam's favourite trap: a team member missing instructions because they live in user-level config (not version-controlled, not shared).
Path-specific rules are the sleeper concept. .claude/rules/ with YAML frontmatter glob patterns like **/*.test.tsx applies conventions across the entire codebase. Directory-level CLAUDE.md cannot do this because it is directory-bound.
Plan mode vs direct execution:
Plan mode: monolith restructuring, multi-file migration, architectural decisions
Direct execution: single-file bug fix, one validation check, clear scope
Know context: fork in skill frontmatter (isolates verbose output). Know -p flag (non-interactive CI/CD). Know an independent review instance catches more than self-review in the same session.
Where to learn this:
Claude Code official docs for CLAUDE.md hierarchy, rules directory, slash commands, skills frontmatter
Claude Code CLI Cheatsheet for commands, skills, hooks, and CI/CD flags in one practical reference
Creating the Perfect CLAUDE.md for real team configuration patterns and MCP integration
What to build: A project with CLAUDE.md hierarchy, .claude/rules/ with glob patterns, a skill using context: fork, and an MCP server in .mcp.json with env var expansion. Test plan mode on a multi-file refactor and direct execution on a single bug fix.

DOMAIN 4: PROMPT ENGINEERING & STRUCTURED OUTPUT (20%)
Two words will save you across this entire domain: be explicit.
"Be conservative" does not improve precision. "Only report high-confidence findings" does not reduce false positives. What works: defining exactly which issues to report versus skip, with concrete code examples for each severity level.
Few-shot examples are the highest-leverage technique tested. 2-4 targeted examples showing ambiguous-case handling with reasoning for why one action was chosen over alternatives.
tool_use with JSON schemas eliminates syntax errors. But NOT semantic errors. Schema design: nullable fields when source data might be absent (prevents fabricated values), "unclear" enum values, "other" + detail strings.
Message Batches API: 50% savings, up to 24-hour processing, no latency SLA, no multi-turn tool calling. Batch for overnight reports. Synchronous for blocking pre-merge checks.
Where to learn this:
Anthropic Prompt Engineering docs for few-shot patterns, explicit criteria, and structured output
Anthropic API Tool Use documentation for tool_use, tool_choice config, JSON schema enforcement
The exam guide's own sample questions (Q10, Q11, Q12) are the single best study material for this domain. Work through every distractor and understand why it is wrong.
What to build: An extraction pipeline using tool_use with required, optional, and nullable fields. Add a validation-retry loop. Run a batch through the Batches API. Handle failures by custom_id.

DOMAIN 5: CONTEXT MANAGEMENT & RELIABILITY (15%)
Smallest weighting. But mistakes here cascade everywhere.
Progressive summarisation kills transactional data. Fix: persistent "case facts" block with extracted amounts, dates, order numbers. Never summarised. Included in every prompt.
"Lost in the middle" effect: models miss findings buried in long inputs. Place key summaries at the beginning.
Three valid escalation triggers: customer requests a human (honour immediately), policy gaps, inability to progress. Two unreliable triggers the exam will tempt you with: sentiment analysis and self-reported confidence scores.
Error propagation done right: structured context (failure type, attempted query, partial results, alternatives). Anti-patterns: silently suppressing errors or killing entire workflows on single failures.
Where to learn this:
Building Agents with the Claude Agent SDK covers context management, error propagation, and escalation design
Agent SDK session docs for resumption, fork_session, /compact
Everything Claude Code repo for battle-tested context management patterns, scratchpad files, and strategic compaction
What to build: A coordinator with two subagents. Simulate a timeout. Verify the coordinator gets structured error context and proceeds with partial results. Test with conflicting sources.

RECOMMENDED LEARNING FROM ANTHROPIC:
1: Building with the Claude API
2: Introduction to Model Context Protocol
3: Claude Code in Action
4: Claude 101

NOW GO AND BECOME A UNCERTIFIED CLAUDE ARCHITECT (or certified if you're a partner ken), EITHER WAY, IT'S TIME TO FUCK!
