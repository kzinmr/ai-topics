# building your own rustc_driver

Source: https://jyn.dev/rustc-driver/

a deeper rabbit hole than expected
what happens when you run
cargo clippy
?
well, we can ask cargo what it does:
$ cargo clippy -v
Checking example v0.1.0 (/home/jyn/src/example)
Running `/home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/clippy-driver /home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rustc --crate-name example --edition=2021 src/main.rs --error-format=json --json=diagnostic-rendered-ansi,artifacts,future-incompat --diagnostic-width=124 --crate-type bin --emit=dep-info,metadata -C embed-bitcode=no -C debuginfo=2 --check-cfg 'cfg(docsrs)' --check-cfg 'cfg(feature, values())' -C metadata=f3baefdd4f0d88a8 -C extra-filename=-f3baefdd4f0d88a8 --out-dir /home/jyn/.cargo/target/debug/deps -C incremental=/home/jyn/.cargo/target/debug/incremental -L dependency=/home/jyn/.cargo/target/debug/deps`

that's kinda weird! it's running something called
clippy-driver
? and passing
bin/rustc
as an argument to it? what's going on there? is it running any other programs afterwards?
we can find that out too:
; strace -f -e execve cargo clippy
all of strace's output
note this is massaged slightly for clarity; the actual command i ran was
cargo clean; strace -f -e execve,clone3 -s 100 cargo clippy 2>&1 | sed 's/Process /\nProcess /; s/execve([^,]*, \([^]]*\).*/execve(\1])/' | rg -v 'resumed>' | rg '(\[pid[^]]*\] )?(execve.*|clone3|Process.*)' -o | sed 's/clone3/clone3()/'
followed by some manual cleanup.

wow, we have like 10 different commands running here!
~/.cargo/bin/cargo clippy -v
~/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/cargo clippy -v
~/.cargo/bin/cargo-clippy -v
~/.rustup/.../cargo-clippy clippy -v
~/.rustup/.../cargo check -v
~/.rustup/.../clippy-driver ~/.rustup/.../rustc -vV
~/.rustup/.../clippy-driver ~/.rustup/../rustc - --print=file-names
~/.rustup/.../clippy-driver ~/.rustup/.../rustc -- --print=sysroot
~/.rustup/.../clippy-driver ~/.rustup/.../rustc -vV
~/.rustup/.../clippy-driver ~/.rustup/../rustc src/main.rs
that's a lot of indirection to compile a simple hello world! let's dig into why it happens.
twice, we see the same binary executed first from
~/.cargo
, then again from
~/.rustup
: for
cargo
and for
cargo-clippy
. what's the difference between these?
let's take a look at the first one that runs:
; strace -e readlink,openat -z ~/.local/lib/cargo/bin/cargo
readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/home/jyn/.local/lib/cargo/bin/cargo", 256) = 36
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/settings.toml", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
; strace -e readlink,openat -s 100 -z ~/.local/lib/cargo/bin/cargo 2>&1| rg 'readlink|openat' | rg -v '"/(lib|etc)'
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/home/jyn/.local/lib/cargo/bin/cargo", 256) = 36
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/settings.toml", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/toolchains", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(3, "nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/rust-installer-version", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/multirust-channel-manifest.toml", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/multirust-config.toml", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
readlink("/proc/self/exe", "/home/jyn/.local/lib/rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/cargo", 4096) = 81
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
it turns out this is something called a
rustup proxy
. this is a little shim that
hardlinks
from the proxy (in this case
cargo
) to rustup. rustup then looks at its own executable name, notices that it's cargo, and picks the right toolchain to run the actual cargo binary.
you can actually ask rustup to just find the path without running it:
; rustup which cargo
/home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/cargo
and you can see that the real cargo doesn't support rustup features like toolchain selectors:
; cargo +nightly --version
cargo 1.81.0-nightly (4dcbca118 2024-06-11)
; $(rustup which cargo) +nightly --version
error: no such command: `+nightly`
Cargo does not handle `+toolchain` directives.
Did you mean to invoke `cargo` through `rustup` instead?
you can even verify for yourself that
~/.cargo/bin/cargo
is just a hardlink by comparing the
inodes
:
; ls -i /home/jyn/.cargo/bin/rustup
32294517 /home/jyn/.cargo/bin/rustup
; ls -i /home/jyn/.cargo/bin/rustc
32294517 /home/jyn/.cargo/bin/rustc
cargo extensions
ok, we've figured out 2/10 of the processes. what are the other 8?
the first one that runs after
cargo clippy
is ...
cargo-clippy
(with a
-
dash, not a space). this is a
cargo extension
;
cargo clippy
is doing very little here other than setting
CARGO
in the environment to point back to itself. why does it need to do that? because
cargo-clippy
is about to call back to cargo: that's process 5,
cargo check
.
what's changed is that
cargo-clippy
has set
RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER
to
clippy-driver
. that means that instead of invoking rustc on each crate, it's going to invoke clippy-driver. and because it's a
WRAPPER
, it gets passed
rustc
as an argument. the intended use-case is for tools like
sccache
that transparently wrap rustc before invoking it;
clippy never invokes rustc as a process
, but there's no equivalent of
RUSTC
that's only used for workspaces.
sysroots and dynamic libraries
now, at this point you might imagine that we have enough info to write our own clippy-like tool that gets invoked instead of rustc. if we look at
compiler/rustc/src/main.rs
in rust-lang/rust
, other than some weird jemalloc stuff, all it does is call
rustc_driver::main
. let's write a toy program that does that.

cargo new driver

oh. huh. that's kinda weird. let's follow those instructions for now though.

...
this is pretty cool! let's install it for our user and see if we can run it on a rust file.
; cargo install --path . --debug

; driver src/main.rs
driver: error while loading shared libraries: librustc_driver-5396912e8af1f65d.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
well that's unfortunate. what happened here?
when we use
cargo run
for our driver, it sets some environment variables. in particular, it sets a variable called
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
:
; strace -s 1000 -v -e execve cargo run 2>&1 >/dev/null | rg debug/driver | rg -o 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[^"]*'
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jyn/.cargo/target/debug/deps:/home/jyn/.cargo/target/debug:/home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:/home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib
and indeed if we set that variable, our driver works again:
; env "$(strace -s 1000 -v -e execve cargo run 2>&1 >/dev/null | rg debug/driver | rg -o 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[^"]*')" driver src/main.rs
this is a custom driver!
what does it do?
well,
the linux documentation project
documents it as follows:
You can temporarily substitute a different library for this particular execution. In Linux, the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated set of directories where libraries should be searched for first, before the standard set of directories; this is useful when debugging a new library or using a nonstandard library for special purposes
"library" here means a shared object library. on linux, these files end with
.so
; on Windows,
.dll
(for "dynamic-link library") ; on MacOS,
.dylib
. these are object files that contain code ("symbols" in linker terms) that are loaded by the linker at runtime, after the rest of your program is loaded into memory. for example, if we look at the rustc binary we copied our driver's code from, it's almost empty:
;; stat -c %s $(rustup which rustc) | numfmt --to=iec
2.6M
instead, almost all the code is in a shared object:
; stat -c %s /home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/librustc_driver-5396912e8af1f65d.so | numfmt --to=iec
136M
that shared object gets loaded at runtime by every rustc_driver:
rustc
,
clippy
,
rustdoc
,
miri
- and our new
driver
tool. it's actually shipped with every toolchain; if you look at the stable toolchain in
.rustup
you'll see it there too. however, what you
won't
see is the
.rmeta
files in the toolchain directory:
; ls /home/jyn/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/*.rmeta | wc -l
228
those are the files we just installed with
rustup component add rustc-dev
. they give rustc the type information it needs to check our
driver
code against the type signatures of all the
rustc_private
internal crates.
building a driver
so! we have learned a bunch of stuff:
when we run
cargo
or
rustc
, that's actually running a "rustup proxy" that picks the toolchain version to use
when we run
cargo clippy
, that's doing a complicated back and forth between cargo and various clippy executables
when we run
rustc
or
clippy-driver
, that's loading a shared object called
librustc_driver.so
at runtime
that's enough info we can now build our own driver!
first, let's make sure we can always run our driver even if we're not going through cargo. it turns out there's a linker flag for this called
-rpath
, which does essentially the same thing as
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
but at link time instead of at runtime. to get the path we need, we can use
rustc --print=sysroot
(we can get the right version of
rustc
from an env variable cargo sets,
RUSTC
). and finally, to tell cargo to pass that flag to the linker, we can write a build script that uses
cargo:rustc-link-arg
.
fn
main
(
)
{
let
rustc
=
std
::
env
::
var
(
"
RUSTC
"
)
.
unwrap
(
)
;
let
output
=
std
::
process
::
Command
::
new
(
rustc
)
.
arg
(
"
--print=sysroot
"
)
.
output
(
)
;
let
stdout
=
String
::
from_utf8
(
output
.
unwrap
(
)
.
stdout
)
.
unwrap
(
)
;
let
sysroot

stdout
.
trim_end
(
)
;
println!
(
"
cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Wl,-rpath=
{sysroot}
/lib
"
)
}
next, we want to be able to invoke this as
cargo driver
, so we need to write a
cargo-driver
program.
use
std
::
env
;
fn
main
(
)
->

let

"
)
;
let
status
=
cmd
.
arg
(
"
build
"
)
.
env
(
"
RUSTC
"
,
driver
)
.
status
(
)
.
unwrap
(
)
;
match
status
.
code
(
)
{
Some
(

)
=>
Ok
(
(

)
,
Some
(
other
)
=>
Err
(
other
)
,
None
=>
Err
(
-
1
)
,
}
}
note that this works fine when using
cargo install
, but when using
cargo run --bin cargo-driver
locally, cargo doesn't rebuild all your binaries automatically - you need to manually run
cargo build
first to make sure both executables are updated.
we get a little silly with it :3
now let's make a program that does something fun! i'm going to disable the
unsafe
checker, so that we can write unsafe programs in "safe" rust.
first, let's tell rust-analyzer that we're using rustc internals in this crate, so we get go-to-definition and other nice things:
[
package
.
metadata
.
rust-analyzer
]
rustc_private
=
true
we also have to configure this per-editor - i use
helix
so i'm going to configure
.helix/languages.toml
. for vscode you'd use
.vscode/settings.json
.
[
language-server
.
rust-analyzer
.
config
]
rust-analyzer
.
rustc
.
source
=
"
discover
"
i'm also going to pin a version of the nightly toolchain, since the internal APIs change quite frequently.

finally, let's write our program.

there's a lot here. i'm not going to cover it all - see
the rustc dev guide
or
generated documentation
for that - but i want to call out two things in particular:
we had to explicitly use
extern crate
to load the rustc_private crates. normally, cargo will pass (e.g.)
--extern cfg-if=~/.cargo/debug/deps/libcfg-if.rmeta
, so rustc loads our dependencies automatically. these crates are being loaded from the
sysroot
, though, so cargo doesn't know about them.
the bit of this driver we actually care about is in
queries.check_unsafety = |...| {}
. that says "override the default function that checks unsafety with our own function". rustc is built on a "query" model where information is pulled instead of pushed - see the dev guide section on
queries
for more information.
let's test out our driver and make sure it works. we'll install it, create a new project that uses unsafe code without an
unsafe
block, and make sure that project compiles.

tada!
a digression: more about rustup proxies
when we built our custom driver, we wrote
driver.rs
and
cargo-driver.rs
, but we never wrote a rustup proxy. how was it picking the right version to run?
well, it was always picking the same version. if we explicitly use a different toolchain - e.g.
stable
- it will still run our custom driver, which uses the nightly toolchain.

ideally, we would instead have our driver respect the version we're passed. that would also mean stuff like
driver +stable
would give a nice error when that version isn't installed, instead of what it currently does:
error: couldn't read +stable: No such file or directory (os error 2)
here is a toy shell script that does that, using the same "read my own process name" trick to dispatch to the right binary:
case
"
$
1
"
in
+
*
)
RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
=
$
(
echo
"
$
1
"
|
cut
-
c
1-
)
;
shift
;;
*
)
RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
=
$
(
rustup
default
|
cut
-
d
'
'
-
f
1
)
esac
exec
rustup run
"
$
RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
"
"
$
(
basename
$
0
)
"
"
$
@
"
exit
1
the other advantage of this shell script is it will let you version your tool. for example, you could install it into
$(rustc --print sysroot)/bin
instead of
~/.cargo/bin
, and have multiple versions depending on what version of rustc it was built with. this is how clippy and the other tools packaged by rustup work, but rustup doesn't support arbitrary drivers, only the hard-coded ones it knows about.
