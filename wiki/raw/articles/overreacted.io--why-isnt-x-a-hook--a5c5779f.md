# Why Isn’t X a Hook?

Source: https://overreacted.io/why-isnt-x-a-hook/

Since the first alpha version of
React Hooks
was released, there is a question that keeps coming up in discussions: “Why isn’t
<some other API>
a Hook?”
To remind you, here’s a few things that
are
Hooks:
But there are some other APIs, like
React.memo()
and
<Context.Provider>
, that are
not
Hooks. Commonly proposed Hook versions of them would be
noncompositional
or
antimodular
. This article will help you understand why.
Note: this post is a deep dive for folks who are interested in API discussions. You don’t need to think about any of this to be productive with React!
There are two important properties that we want React APIs to preserve:
Composition:
Custom Hooks
are largely the reason we’re excited about the Hooks API. We expect people to build their own Hooks very often, and we need to make sure Hooks written by different people
don’t conflict
. (Aren’t we all spoiled by how components compose cleanly and don’t break each other?)
Debugging:
We want the bugs to be
easy to find
as the application grows. One of React’s best features is that if you see something wrong rendered, you can walk up the tree until you find which component’s prop or state caused the mistake.
These two constraints put together can tell us what can or
cannot
be a Hook. Let’s try a few examples.
Multiple custom Hooks each calling
useState()
don’t conflict:
function
useMyCustomHook1
()
{
const [
value
,
setValue
]
=
useState
(
0
);
// What happens here, stays here.
}
function
useMyCustomHook2
()
{
const [
value
,
setValue
]
=
useState
(
0
);
// What happens here, stays here.
}
function
MyComponent
()
{
useMyCustomHook1
();
useMyCustomHook2
();
// ...
}
Adding a new unconditional
useState()
call is always safe. You don’t need to know anything about other Hooks used by a component to declare a new state variable. You also can’t break other state variables by updating one of them.
Verdict:
✅
useState()
doesn’t make custom Hooks fragile.
Hooks are useful because you can pass values
between
Hooks:
function
useWindowWidth
()
{
const [
width
,
setWidth
]
=
useState
(
window
.
innerWidth
);
// ...
return
width
;
}
function
useTheme
(
isMobile
)
{
// ...
}
function
Comment
()
{
const
width
=
useWindowWidth
();
const
isMobile
=
width
<
MOBILE_VIEWPORT
;
const
theme
=
useTheme
(
isMobile
);
return
(
<
section
className={
theme
.
comment
}>
{
/* ... */
}
</
section
>
);
}
But what if we make a mistake? What’s the debugging story?
Let’s say the CSS class we get from
theme.comment
is wrong. How would we debug this? We can set a breakpoint or a few logs in the body of our component.
Maybe we’d see that
theme
is wrong but
width
and
isMobile
are correct. That would tell us the problem is inside
useTheme()
. Or perhaps we’d see that
width
itself is wrong. That would tell us to look into
useWindowWidth()
.
A single look at the intermediate values tells us which of the Hooks at the top level contains the bug.
We don’t need to look at
all
of their implementations.
Then we can “zoom in” on the one that has a bug, and repeat.
This becomes more important if the depth of custom Hook nesting increases. Imagine we have 3 levels of custom Hook nesting, each level using 3 different custom Hooks inside. The
difference
between looking for a bug in
3 places
versus potentially checking
3 + 3×3 + 3×3×3 = 39 places
is enormous. Luckily,
useState()
can’t magically “influence” other Hooks or components. A buggy value returned by it leaves a trail behind it, just like any variable. 🐛
Verdict:
✅
useState()
doesn’t obscure the cause-effect relationship in our code. We can follow the breadcrumbs directly to the bug.
As an optimization, components using Hooks can bail out of re-rendering.
One way to do it is to put a
React.memo()
wrapper around the whole component. It bails out of re-rendering if props are shallowly equal to what we had during the last render. This makes it similar to
PureComponent
in classes.
React.memo()
takes a component and returns a component:
function
Button
(
props
)
{
// ...
}
export
default
React
.
memo
(
Button
);
But why isn’t it just a Hook?
Whether you call it
useShouldComponentUpdate()
,
usePure()
,
useSkipRender()
, or
useBailout()
, the proposal tends to look something like this:
function
Button
(
{ color }
)
{
// ⚠️ Not a real API
useBailout
(
prevColor
=>
prevColor
!==
color
,
color
);
return
(
<
button
className={
'
button-
'
+
color
}>
OK
</
button
>
)
}
There are a few more variations (e.g. a simple
usePure()
marker) but in broad strokes they have the same flaws.
Let’s say we try to put
useBailout()
in two custom Hooks:
function
useFriendStatus
(
friendID
)
{
const [
isOnline
,
setIsOnline
]
=
useState
(
null
);
// ⚠️ Not a real API
useBailout
(
prevIsOnline
=>
prevIsOnline
!==
isOnline
,
isOnline
);
useEffect
(()
=>
{
const
handleStatusChange
=
status
=>
setIsOnline
(
status
.
isOnline
);
ChatAPI
.
subscribe
(
friendID
,
handleStatusChange
);
return
()
=>
ChatAPI
.
unsubscribe
(
friendID
,
handleStatusChange
);
});
return
isOnline
;
}
function
useWindowWidth
()
{
const [
width
,
setWidth
]
=
useState
(
window
.
innerWidth
);
// ⚠️ Not a real API
useBailout
(
prevWidth
=>
prevWidth
!==
width
,
width
);
useEffect
(()
=>
{
const
handleResize
=
()
=>
setWidth
(
window
.
innerWidth
);
window
.
addEventListener
(
'
resize
'
,
handleResize
);
return
()
=>
window
.
removeEventListener
(
'
resize
'
,
handleResize
);
});
return
width
;
}
Now what happens if you use them both in the same component?
function
ChatThread
(
{ friendID
,
isTyping }
)
{
const
width
=
useWindowWidth
();
const
isOnline
=
useFriendStatus
(
friendID
);
return
(
<
ChatLayout
width={
width
}>
<
FriendStatus
isOnline={
isOnline
} />
{
isTyping
&&
'
Typing...
'
}
</
ChatLayout
>
);
}
When does it re-render?
If every
useBailout()
call has the power to skip an update, then updates from
useWindowWidth()
would be blocked by
useFriendStatus()
, and vice versa.
These Hooks would break each other.
However, if
useBailout()
was only respected when
all
calls to it inside a single component “agree” to block an update, our
ChatThread
would fail to update on changes to the
isTyping
prop.
Even worse, with these semantics
any newly added Hooks to
ChatThread
would break if they don’t
also
call
useBailout()
. Otherwise, they can’t “vote against” the bailout inside
useWindowWidth()
and
useFriendStatus()
.
Verdict:
🔴
useBailout()
breaks composition. Adding it to a Hook breaks state updates in other Hooks. We want the APIs to be
antifragile
, and this behavior is pretty much the opposite.
How does a Hook like
useBailout()
affect debugging?
We’ll use the same example:
function
ChatThread
(
{ friendID
,
isTyping }
)
{
const
width
=
useWindowWidth
();
const
isOnline
=
useFriendStatus
(
friendID
);
return
(
<
ChatLayout
width={
width
}>
<
FriendStatus
isOnline={
isOnline
} />
{
isTyping
&&
'
Typing...
'
}
</
ChatLayout
>
);
}
Let’s say the
Typing...
label doesn’t appear when we expect, even though somewhere many layers above the prop is changing. How do we debug it?
Normally, in React you can confidently answer this question by looking
up
.
If
ChatThread
doesn’t get a new
isTyping
value, we can open the component that renders
<ChatThread isTyping={myVar} />
and check
myVar
, and so on. At one of these levels, we’ll either find a buggy
shouldComponentUpdate()
bailout, or an incorrect
isTyping
value being passed down. One look at each component in the chain is usually enough to locate the source of the problem.
However, if this
useBailout()
Hook was real, you would never know the reason an update was skipped until you checked
every single custom Hook
(deeply) used by our
ChatThread
and components in its owner chain. Since every parent component can
also
use custom Hooks, this
scales
terribly.
It’s like if you were looking for a screwdriver in a chest of drawers, and each drawer contained a bunch of smaller chests of drawers, and you don’t know how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Verdict:
🔴 Not only
useBailout()
Hook breaks composition, but it also vastly increases the number of debugging steps and cognitive load for finding a buggy bailout — in some cases, exponentially.
We just looked at one real Hook,
useState()
, and a common suggestion that is intentionally
not
a Hook —
useBailout()
. We compared them through the prism of Composition and Debugging, and discussed why one of them works and the other one doesn’t.
While there is no “Hook version” of
memo()
or
shouldComponentUpdate()
, React
does
provide a Hook called
useMemo()
. It serves a similar purpose, but its semantics are different enough to not run into the pitfalls described above.
useBailout()
is just one example of something that doesn’t work well as a Hook. But there are a few others — for example,
useProvider()
,
useCatch()
, or
useSuspense()
.
Can you see why?
