# Linker I/O tricks and their downsides

Source: https://maskray.me/blog/linker-io-tricks-and-their-downsides

mold and wild enable several tricks by default that other linkers
don't do. This post looks at three of them:
overwrite an existing output file in place instead of creating a new
file
fork a child to do the link, so that the parent can exit before the
child releases its memory
ask the kernel for transparent huge pages
Each saves a few percent of wall time in an edit-relink loop. Each
also breaks an assumption that build systems, debuggers, and profilers
make about a process. I measured what they save and what they break.
Setup: Linux 6.18, i7-14700K (28 threads), ext4 on a SATA SSD,
transparent huge pages
enabled=always
. GNU ld 2.47, gold
2.47, LLD 23, mold 2.42.1 (TODO: I used the Rust port under development;
check against the C++ release), wild at commit 47cc8e8e.
Overwrite the output file in
place
History
In 2006, Ali Bahrami wrote
Settling
An Old Score (Linker Division)
. The Solaris linker truncated and
rewrote an existing output file in place. It killed any running process
that had the old file mapped, with a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS far from the real
cause. Linux and macOS linkers unlinked the old file and created a new
one. Bahrami filed PSARC 2006/353 to switch Solaris to
unlink-then-create.
GNU ld, gold, and lld still work this way. A successful relink
creates a new inode and leaves other hard links alone. A failed relink
removes the output and leaves other hard links alone. lld unlinks the
old file first (
unlinkAsync
: open it, unlink it, close the
descriptor on another thread so that freeing its blocks is off the
critical path), mmaps a temporary file
<out>.tmp%%%%%%%
in the same directory, and renames
it over the output on success.
mold
mold went back to in-place overwriting almost from the start. Its
November 2020 history has commits trying
O_TRUNC
and
O_DIRECT
; after them the output is opened without
O_TRUNC
.
Commit
8a415515
(2020-12-23, "Handle ETXTBSY") added the current scheme,
released in v0.1:
rename the existing output to
.<name>.<pid>
open it read-write without
O_TRUNC
,
ftruncate
to the new size,
fallocate
, mmap,
write
rename it back at the end
if the open fails with
ETXTBSY
(the file is being
executed), unlink the renamed original and create a new file
If the link fails after the output is opened (a relocation out of
range, a disk-full SIGBUS), the cleanup handler unlinks the temporary
file. On this path the temporary file is the original inode.
Issue #188
(2021-12) asked for create-and-rename. The fix in v1.3.0 (2022-05) only
disabled overwriting for
-shared
. The comment explains
why:
By default, mold tries to ovewrite to an output file if exists
because at least on Linux, writing to an existing file is much faster
than creating a fresh file and writing to it. However, if an existing
file is in use, writing to it will mess up processes that are executing
that file. Linux prevents a write to a running executable file; it
returns ETXTBSY on open(2). However, that mechanism doesn't protect .so
files. Therefore, we want to disable this optimization if we are
creating a shared object file.
Then the kernel changed. Linux 6.11 stopped denying writes to running
executables (
commit
2a010c412853
, "fs: don't block i_writecount during exec"). Its
message says: "Yes, someone in userspace could potentially be relying on
this. It's not completely out of the realm of possibility but let's find
out if that's actually the case and not guess."
In October 2024,
issue #1361
reported that ninja's bootstrap segfaulted on Gentoo with mold 2.34.1.
The stage-1 ninja was running while the stage-2 link rewrote its inode.
This is Bahrami's scenario. It took a week and an
rr
recording to find. mold 2.35.0 disabled the reuse on 6.11 and later. Rui
Ueyama reported the regression to LKML. Christian Brauner asked on the
mold issue whether mold could keep its workaround so that the kernel
could keep the change, "as this was done for the sake of new work and
because the mechanism is really broken", then reverted it for 6.13 (
commit
3b832035387f
, Cc stable): "It seems we found out that someone is
relying on this obscure behavior. So revert the change." mold 2.36.0
re-enabled the reuse on 6.13 and later. 6.11 and 6.12 stay excluded: the
revert was backported, but distribution kernels can't be told apart by
version number.
I commented on the issue that this feels like an instance of Hyrum's
Law. A few years earlier I had insisted that llvm-objcopy emulate
cp
's overwrite behavior, before I realized the merit of
atomic rename.
wild
wild added
--update-in-place
in
January
2025
: "On one benchmark (rustc without debug) this gave about a 4%
speedup. On another (clang with debug) the difference was small enough
that it was hard to measure." It became the default on Linux in
November
2025
, with
--no-update-in-place
added
a
month later
. wild opens the output path itself without truncation,
falls back to unlink-and-replace on
ETXTBSY
, and always
unlinks for shared objects and on macOS (the code signature cache is
keyed by inode). Neither mold nor wild checks
st_nlink
.

ls

mold -o a.out a.o
ls

ls
-li a.out b.out
readelf -h b.out | grep Entry
a.out
is gone (it was the temporary file).
b.out
holds the half-written output of the failed link. GNU
ld, gold, and lld would have left
b.out
as the last good
binary.
Hard-linked outputs are common. Cargo hard-links
target/debug/deps/foo-<hash>
to
target/debug/foo
. rustc relinks
deps/foo-<hash>
while
target/debug/foo
still names the previous inode. So a failed relink corrupts
target/debug/foo
, and a successful one rewrites it in
place. In my mold checkout,
target/release/mold
and
target/release/deps/mold-75e55cc9443d1590
share one
inode.
Hard-link snapshots of a build tree are the other victims:
1

cp
-al build snap-cp
rsync -a --link-dest=../build build/ snap-rsync/
mold -o build/a.out build/a.o --image-base=0x400000
cmp good snap-cp/a.out
What the guards miss
ETXTBSY
works for its intended case. With
b.out
running, the relink creates a new inode and the
running program keeps the old one:
1
./b.out & mold -o a.out a.o;
ls
-li a.out b.out
But the kernel only denies writes to an inode that is being
execve
d. A process that just maps the file
(
mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE)
, which is what
every user-space ELF loader does) doesn't count. With such a process
alive,
open(O_RDWR)
succeeds and mold reuses the inode.
qemu-user is the important case. It maps the guest binary's segments
MAP_PRIVATE
from the file descriptor
(
linux-user/elfload.c
,
imgsrc_mmap
). When it
is invoked through binfmt_misc, the kernel's write denial goes to
mm->exe_file
, which is the interpreter, not the guest
binary: when a binfmt handler substitutes an interpreter,
fs/exec.c
releases the original file's denial and
begin_new_exec
pins the interpreter (a binfmt_misc
T
flag merged after v7.2 changes this).
A static aarch64 program that prints a string from
.data
every 200 ms, started through binfmt_misc (
flags: PF
):

./guest > out.txt &
readlink
/proc/$!/exe
ls
-i guest
mold -m aarch64linux -o guest new.o
ls
-i guest
tr
'\n'
' '
< out.txt
The running process's output changed. Its
MAP_PRIVATE
data page was still the page-cache page that the linker wrote through.
For a code page qemu hasn't translated yet, or a data structure
mid-update, this is Bahrami's crash. The same applies to anything that
maps or reads an executable without exec'ing it: a
dlopen
ed
PIE, valgrind, a
cp
or
rsync
in flight.
-shared
covers only the most common member of this
class.
What it saves
The saving comes from the page cache. Pages of a recently written
output are still resident, and a write fault on a resident page is
cheaper than allocating and zeroing a new one. To isolate the output
side, I linked one 2 GiB
.data
section
(
objcopy -I binary
of
/dev/urandom
), so the
link is just a copy. The output is on ext4 on a SATA SSD (all numbers in
this section are). Warm page cache:
in place
new inode
mold
0.14 s
0.38 s
wild
0.09 s
0.17 s
lld
0.37 s
That's 40–120 ms per GiB of output, an upper bound. For a real link
it is a few percent, matching wild's commit message. lld's path is at
parity with mold's non-reuse path. Note that "relink the same output N
times and take the minimum" is the best case for this trick.
The pages are not always resident: after a reboot, after a large
build, on a memory-constrained CI machine. Then the first write to each
page of the existing file is a fault that has to read the old page from
disk before it can be overwritten. A new file just zero-fills.

The in-place link reads the old 2 GiB back at SATA speed, only to
overwrite it. wild: 3.79 s in place, 0.15 s with
--no-update-in-place
. Network storage would be worse. A
linker that wants to keep the trick could check
cachestat(2)
(Linux 6.5) and
st_nlink == 1
.
I don't plan to adopt this in lld. It changes semantics other tools
rely on, it depends on a kernel behavior that was removed once, it is
Linux-only, and it gains a few percent in the best case with a 10× cliff
in the worst.
Fork so that the parent
can exit early
Mechanism
Before starting any thread, mold creates a pipe and forks. The parent
blocks on the pipe. The child does the whole link. After the output file
is closed and renamed, the child writes one byte to the pipe. The parent
calls
_exit(0)
without waiting for the child. The child
then releases its input mappings in parallel and exits. If the child
dies before writing the byte, the parent
waitpid
s and
propagates the status. The comment: "Exiting from a program with large
memory usage is slow -- it may take a few hundred milliseconds. To hide
the latency, we fork a child and let it do the actual linking work."
--no-fork
disables it.
wild does the same, with the same pipe protocol and the same
--no-fork
.
What it saves
The hidden latency is the kernel's
exit_mmap
, which
frees the address space on one thread. A program that touches N GiB of
anonymous memory and then measures
_exit
to
wait()
in the parent:
heap
1 GiB
4 GiB
8 GiB
4 KiB pages (
PR_SET_THP_DISABLE
)
37 ms
148 ms
203 ms
huge pages
2 ms
6 ms
36 ms
So the saving depends on whether the heap uses huge pages. mold's
does here: it uses mimalloc and calls
prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, 0)
at startup, so with
enabled=always
99.8% of its 1.7 GB heap was in
AnonHugePages
. (That
prctl
also undid my first
attempt to disable THP from a wrapper. I had to intercept the call with
LD_PRELOAD
.)
A synthetic link with 5.8M symbols and a ~1.5 GB heap, interleaved, 5
runs each:
heap
fork
--no-fork
4 KiB pages
0.37–0.40 s
0.44–0.46 s
huge pages
0.48–0.50 s
0.50–0.51 s
60–70 ms with 4 KiB pages, matching the table above. About 10 ms with
huge pages. On a 43 MB output (the C++ mold: 700 objects, 400 MB linker
RSS) the difference was not measurable.
What it breaks
The parent is the process the build system spawned and the only one
it
wait
s for. The child is reparented to init or a
subreaper. Nothing that watched the parent sees it again.
Resource accounting sees nothing.
/usr/bin/time
, the
shell's
time
,
getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN)
, and
anything else built on
wait4
report the parent:
1
2

4
/usr/bin/time -f
"wall=%e user=%U sys=%S maxrss=%MkB"
mold @ld.args
/usr/bin/time -f
"wall=%e user=%U sys=%S maxrss=%MkB"
mold --no-fork @ld.args
wild: 4 MB reported, 1.65 GB actual. The wall time also stops at the
notification, so a wall-clock comparison between a fork-mode linker and
another linker doesn't measure the same interval.
gdb follows the parent by default and detaches from the child, so a
breakpoint in the link never fires:
1
2

4
(gdb) break rename
(gdb) run
[Detaching after fork from child process 2677804]
[Inferior 1 (process 2677801) exited normally]
set follow-fork-mode child
or
--no-fork
fixes it.
strace
needs
-f
: without it you see
the parent's 252 syscalls (exec,
pipe
, one
clone
, a
read
), not the child's 19,801.
perf stat
works: its default counter inheritance includes
the child, even after the parent exits (774 ms task-clock for fork mode,
648 ms for
--no-fork
).
The job slot is freed before the memory is. When the parent exits,
make or ninja starts the next job while the orphan is still freeing its
heap. I ran four links under
make -jN
in a transient cgroup
(
systemd-run --user --scope
) and sampled the cgroup's
anonymous memory every 5 ms. The orphan stays in the cgroup, so this is
the build's real footprint:
heap
-j1
fork
-j1
--no-fork
-j2
fork
-j2
--no-fork
4 KiB pages
2.13 GB
1.50 GB
3.44 GB
2.97 GB
huge pages
1.72 GB
1.72 GB
3.43 GB
3.42 GB
With 4 KiB pages,
-j1
peaks 40% above one link, and
-j2
about 15% above. With huge pages the orphan is gone in
~5 ms and there is no difference. The excess is bounded by one heap per
job slot and lasts for the orphan's lifetime. It is a margin problem,
not a doubling. But a machine sized to the edge of RAM has that much
less margin, and the build system can't see it.
Per-process RSS can't see it either. Within half a millisecond of the
parent's exit, the orphan shows
State: Z
with no
VmRSS
in
/proc/<pid>/status
, and
statm
reads 0, while the cgroup still holds 1.5 GB for
another 60 ms. (In
exit_group
, each thread drops its
mm
before the last one runs
exit_mmap
, and
/proc/<pid>
reports the group leader.) Only
system-wide or cgroup counters see it.
Errors after the notification are lost. The parent has reported
success before the child releases its mappings and exits. Nothing in
that window can change the exit status.
Assessment
With a 4 KiB-page heap the trick saves the kernel's exit cost, 25–40
ms per GiB of heap, a few hundred milliseconds for a multi-gigabyte
debug link. With transparent huge pages, which mold enables for itself,
it saves about 10 ms on the same link. In exchange, the linker is no
longer the process the build system started, and every tool built on
wait4
misreports it. If you benchmark, profile, debug, or
memory-budget a build with mold or wild, pass
--no-fork
.
Ask for huge pages
Mechanism
mold calls
madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)
on its output file
mapping (
src/output-file-unix.cc
: "Linking a Chromium debug
build is ~20% faster with this"), its arena allocator
(
lib/arena.cc
), and its large hash tables
(
lib/lib.h
). It also calls
prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE, 0)
at startup to undo an
inherited THP-disable flag. wild hints its output mapping by default
since
September
2026
. lld does not hint.
madvise
only sets
VM_HUGEPAGE
on the
mapping. The effect comes at page faults. The first touch of each 2 MiB
of an anonymous region asks the allocator for a physically contiguous 2
MiB block.
A free block exists: the fault returns a huge page. With
enabled=always
, an unadvised region gets one too.
No free block, because free memory is fragmented or low: an
unadvised region takes a 4 KiB page and moves on. An advised region,
under the default
defrag=madvise
, allocates with
__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM
(
vma_thp_gfp_mask()
in
mm/huge_memory.c
). The faulting thread runs compaction
itself, moving other processes' pages out of a candidate block until 2
MiB is free, and reclaim first if memory is low.
Compaction fails when every candidate block holds a page that can't
be moved. The fault then retries with a 4 KiB page, having paid for the
attempt.
The hint opts the program into doing the kernel's defragmentation in
its own page faults. The output file mapping is a milder case: page
cache large folios use
readahead_gfp_mask()
, which adds
__GFP_NORETRY
, so that path gives up quickly.
What it does
Free 2 MiB blocks are scarce on an ordinary developer machine. This
one has been up 48 days: 18 GB free, but only 3,400 free 2 MiB blocks
(6.6 GB) in
/proc/buddyinfo
. A Chromium debug link (13 GB
of inputs, 4.5 GB output, 19.6 GB linker RSS) uses them up.
nohuge.so
is an
LD_PRELOAD
shim that turns
madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)
into a no-op.

Both runs get the same 3,700 huge pages;
enabled=always
does that without the hint. The hint adds 550 compaction stalls per
link, 80% of them failed, and the link is slower and noisier. The ~20%
may hold with more free contiguous memory, or with
enabled=madvise
, where nothing gets huge pages without the
hint. I have no data for those.
Adding the hint to lld (an
LD_PRELOAD
wrapper that calls
madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE)
after every

of 2
MiB or more) changes nothing either:
